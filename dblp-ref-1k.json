{"abstract": "This paper describes the design and implementation of a methodology for the visualisation and hypothetical virtual reconstruction of Roman polychrome statuary for research purposes. The methodology is intended as an attempt to move beyond visualisations which are simply believable towards a more physically accurate approach. Accurate representations of polychrome statuary have great potential utility both as a means of illustrating existing interpretations and as a means of testing and revising developing hypotheses. The goal of this methodology is to propose a pipeline which incorporates a high degree of physical accuracy whilst also being practically applicable in a conventional archaeological research setting. The methodology is designed to allow the accurate visualisation of surviving objects and colourants as well as providing reliable methods for the hypothetical reconstruction of elements which no longer survive. The process proposed here is intended to limit the need for specialist recording equipment, utilising existing data and those data which can be collected using widely available technology. It is at present being implemented as part of the 'Statues in Context' project at Herculaneum and will be demonstrated here using the case study of a small area of the head of a painted female statue discovered at Herculaneum in 2006.", "authors": ["Gareth Beale", "Graeme Earl"], "n_citation": 50, "references": ["10482dd3-4642-4193-842f-85f3b70fcf65", "3133714c-f979-4d84-9224-97361cf053ab", "3a926fef-7422-4654-8776-8e31b45be563", "52f480e8-85e6-4c01-9e5b-d75eabf6a8ec", "6f52f995-7c4c-4a92-83aa-d1c9fbd2465c", "8bd964d6-c45f-448c-9e65-efe5f98ca0a0", "8fa0a362-6522-48fc-bd5e-24de00ed6511", "9bfa8c24-8fb6-44d9-ba42-38b22f9cf34b", "b57cc9ef-64b6-479d-9918-5f283af3219d", "b678b546-e867-4a57-8963-c5545b04f32d", "e5c40bf5-7ee2-4cff-a75a-b708ab69997b", "f0dccb0c-c17a-4fcb-a89f-fe4bdfa3356d", "fdd93623-31c8-487b-8554-d6c6b25af5f6"], "title": "A methodology for the physically accurate visualisation of roman polychrome statuary", "venue": "visual analytics science and technology", "year": 2011, "id": "001c58d3-26ad-46b3-ab3a-c1e557d16821"}

{"abstract": "Recent achievements in Natural Language Processing (NLP) and Psychology invoke the challenges to identify the insight of emotions. In the present study, we have identified different psychology related theme words while analyzing emotions on the interview data of ISEAR (International Survey of Emotion Antecedents and Reactions) research group. Primarily, we have developed a Graphical User Interface (GUI) to generate visual graphs for analyzing the impact of emotions with respect to different background, behavioral and physiological variables available in the ISEAR dataset. We have discussed some of the interesting results as observed from the generated visual graphs. On the other hand, different text clusters are identified from the interview statements by selecting individual as well as different combinations of the variables. Such textual clusters are used not only for retrieving the psychological theme words but also to classify the theme words into their respective emotion classes. In order to retrieve the psychological theme words from the text clusters, we have developed a rule based baseline system considering unigram based keyword spotting technique. The system has been evaluated based on a Top-n ranking strategy (where n=10, 20 or 30 most frequent theme words). Overall, the system achieves the average F-Scores of .42, .32, .36, .42, .35, .40 and .40 in identifying theme words with respect to Joy, Anger, Disgust, Fear, Guilt, Sadness and Shame emotion classes, respectively.", "authors": ["Ankita Brahmachari", "Priya Singh", "Avdhesh Garg", "Dipankar Das"], "n_citation": 0, "references": ["84d47128-58d0-4187-aa44-389fde7d5c83", "e0dce69e-5bb6-4835-a624-066f5cd0420b", "f4b32fa0-8bc6-422b-999c-d2c32e261e1f"], "title": "Identifying Psychological Theme Words from Emotion Annotated Interviews", "venue": "", "year": 2013, "id": "00a119c4-d367-4607-b3c8-b237f2971bff"}

{"abstract": "Three speech training systems for hearing-impaired children were designed and constructed using a minicomputer and a microprocessor. The first system displays the lateral shape of the vocal tract for each vowel estimated from the speech sound. In this system, three storages are prepared. One of them can be used to store a reference shape which may be estimated from a teacher's voice or a prepared standard shape. A child can articulate seeing the reference shape and re-articulate comparing his own first articulation with the reference shape. The system can also compare the estimated shape with the reference one and produce instructions with animated cartoons which show where any articulatory defects exist. The second system displays successively the lateral shapes for articulation of any phoneme sequences containing consonants. The third system displays the first two formant frequencies extracted from speech as a spot on the F1-F2 plane, where the regions of vowels are shown in color. Preliminary use of these devices has shown that they complement each other to form a more effective system of speech training.", "authors": ["Minoru Shigenaga", "Yoshihiro Sekiguchi"], "n_citation": 0, "title": "Speech training systems using lateral shapes of vocal tract and F1-F2 diagram for hearing-impaired children", "venue": "international joint conference on artificial intelligence", "year": 1979, "id": "00ca027b-5174-40fa-bf63-9a97c2a5f518"}

{"abstract": "Spatial encryption is a generic public-key cryptosystem where vectors play the role of public keys and secret keys are associated to affine spaces. Any secret key associated to a space can decrypt all ciphertexts encrypted for vectors in that space, and the delegation relation is defined by subspace inclusion. Though several constructions of spatial encryption schemes have been proposed in the literature, none of them are known to remain secure in the leakage-resilient setting, in which the adversary may be capable of learning limited additional information about the master secret key and other secret keys in the system. In this paper, we propose the first spatial encryption scheme achieving leakage resilience in the standard model, based on existing static assumptions over bilinear groups of composite order. Our new scheme is based on the leakageresilient HIBE scheme by Lewko, Rouselakis, and Waters in TCC 2011 and can be seen as a generalization of Moriyama-Doi spatial encryption scheme to the leakage-resilient setting.", "authors": ["Michel Abdalla", "Jill-J\u00eann Vie"], "n_citation": 50, "references": ["3140c9ba-8d98-42a7-b6b8-c58fdaa8fe75", "4708b4d5-ddd8-48f7-ab7f-e14f925fbe62", "7432d716-a4ae-42f8-9dae-6599b6f3b475", "ad0777e4-aab4-41b1-928a-2844e2da585e", "b6aea9c9-30b3-4fcb-bf8f-adb19920c137", "c086c363-f6a2-475e-9ffa-23f3c5fffcf7", "f40ff3ec-979e-4f88-ab47-520879876fed", "fb9ea451-ad58-40da-be73-6e60b6607f8f"], "title": "Leakage-Resilient spatial encryption", "venue": "", "year": 2012, "id": "016a9a21-e882-4cda-a2b1-b2b46f10601e"}

{"abstract": "Breast cancer is the most common form of cancer in women. Early diagnosis is necessary for effective treatment and therefore of crucial importance. Medical thermography has been demonstrated an effective and inexpensive method for detecting breast cancer, in particular in early stages and in dense tissue. In this paper, we propose a medical decision support system based on analysing bilateral asymmetries in breast thermograms. The underlying data is imbalanced, as the number of benign cases significantly exceeds that of malignant ones, which will lead to problems for conventional pattern recognition algorithms. To address this, we propose an ensemble classifier system which is based on the idea of Clustering and Selection. The feature space, which is derived from a series of image symmetry features, is partitioned in order to decompose the problem into a set of simpler decision areas. We then delegate a locally competent classifier to each of the generated clusters. The set of predictors is composed of both standard models as well as models dedicated to imbalanced classification, so that we are able to employ a specialised classifier to clusters that show high class imbalance, while maintaining a high specificity for other clusters. We demonstrate that our method provides excellent classification performance and that it statistically outperforms several state-of-the-art ensembles dedicated to imbalanced problems.", "authors": ["Bartosz Krawczyk", "Gerald Schaefer", "Shao Ying Zhu"], "n_citation": 50, "references": ["16f0341b-538d-40f3-996c-8de7cc4dc675", "1ca19102-96fb-4b4b-a469-88ad17f36b11", "38135245-8eff-4078-af6a-ea559ffa660b", "3cbd262f-bf3c-4fcd-a143-dd1a6be49e4b", "5355c319-b80d-40de-bf24-5ab2f95cb7b1", "64b37c52-2186-4398-ba45-5566f33642ce", "87b6c1da-c179-412e-8934-228784c9c82b", "9075487a-8183-4565-ac94-0197da31e056", "a6e178c8-d55f-460c-8e5b-c9d5cfb04c20", "af647f42-0b8d-480b-a36e-c7f351a95473", "b1e0b2d0-8a1e-42f5-8645-9fae30b8636f", "c52208d6-0dfb-400f-a19b-ed6fedfaea19", "e6b6e8f4-3c7d-4435-8ca9-192c3a76cdf8"], "title": "Breast Cancer Identification Based on Thermal Analysis and a Clustering and Selection Classification Ensemble", "venue": "", "year": 2013, "id": "0265aea8-65f3-4f46-b8b1-6b65bcb1d38f"}

{"abstract": "The development of an automated system for the quality assessment of aerodrome ground lighting (AGL), in accordance with associated standards and recommendations, is presented. The system is composed of an image sensor, placed inside the cockpit of an aircraft to record images of the AGL during a normal descent to an aerodrome. A model-based methodology is used to ascertain the optimum match between a template of the AGL and the actual image data in order to calculate the position and orientation of the camera at the instant the image was acquired. The camera position and orientation data are used along with the pixel grey level for each imaged luminaire, to estimate a value for the luminous intensity of a given luminaire. This can then be compared with the expected brightness for that luminaire to ensure it is operating to the required standards. As such, a metric for the quality of the AGL pattern is determined. Experiments on real image data is presented to demonstrate the application and effectiveness of the system.", "authors": ["J. Niblock", "Jian-Xun Peng", "Karen McMenemy", "George W.

{"abstract": "Quality specified image retrieval is helpful to improve the user experiences in mobile searching and social media sharing. However, the model for evaluating the quality of the user generated images, which are popular in social media sharing, remains unexploited. In this paper, we propose a scheme for quality assessment on user generated image. The scheme is formed by four attribute dimensions, including intrinsic quality, favorability, relevancy and accessibility of images. Each of the dimensions is defined and modeled to pool a final quality score of a user generated image. The proposed scheme can reveal the quality of user generated image in comprehensive manner. Experimental results show that the scores obtained by our scheme have high correlation coefficients with the benchmark data. Therefore, our scheme is suitable for quality specified image retrieval on mobile applications.", "authors": ["Qiong Liu", "You Yang", "Xu Wang", "Liujuan Cao"], "n_citation": 3, "references": ["04f8d077-765a-4145-bf14-bace8fc3a7c9", "07b11cc1-12ca-44d4-bcca-702d4d306dfd", "0d2e42c4-595d-449f-8738-2f0553763772", "117fa766-80c7-414e-9f65-5ae1a057fdd6", "19b5f75e-faec-42bb-a795-d6728e493ae8", "27ac42a2-1eb4-4060-80a6-c0a0566bfaf0", "30da015e-fc53-4de5-91b8-18e28f1281d2", "4c859183-ef97-49be-ba88-e096def9acf2", "638ae38d-2880-4c40-8bfc-86510ec17c96", "71198e87-8fba-4bb9-9b0e-286820c815b1", "7dff52ca-5ee1-416f-9e54-8e4a2e42ef9e", "7f1214b2-e070-4ff2-a5d3-647e7c16c2d7", "8575572a-2b87-4cbb-b260-746ddedc4637", "900e5460-9bf1-4fc9-a709-48f16cad4b77", "96564de0-6158-4564-abdf-1533164ae91f", "adea5377-3a51-4831-add5-80ebf31685e1", "c09dd382-6958-408b-aea7-4f5972031e4e", "c2b03f8f-8de3-40a2-ba0e-f0c9142151d3", "c5799806-44a9-4e53-a9ef-0482abc74bf2", "c8263f04-6d4e-4828-89de-f5418cefd1d7", "caaff64a-e3cb-4f06-a292-34994f34417c", "dd4eb389-91ba-498c-b37e-ff757fd1a30f", "ea0912eb-9116-42e7-b7db-fdd1f0b2d6f1", "eb3f6c15-20d6-4d73-8412-cbe15df31bbf", "feddae21-3c05-4743-80fa-b8e101f1b93f"], "title": "Quality Assessment on User Generated Image for Mobile Search Application", "venue": "conference on multimedia modeling", "year": 2013, "id": "02a5e8a8-061e-4c1f-ab16-bda035578e54"}

The stability of the solutions is discussed, and the methods of competitive modes is used to describe parameter regimes for which chaotic behaviors may appear. Numerical solutions are employed to better demonstrate the dependence of traveling wave solutions on the physical parameters in the Yukawa model.

{"abstract": "The paper discusses the design principles and current status of a natural language front end for access to data bases. This Is based on the use, first, of a semantically-oriented question analyser exploiting general, language-wide semantic categories and patterns, rather than data base-specific ones; and, second, of a data base-oriented translation component for obtaining search specifications from the meaning representations for questions derived by the analyser. This approach is motivated by the desire to reduce the effort of providing data base-specific material for the front end, by the belief that a general analyser is well suited to the \"casual\" data base user, and by the assumption that the rich semantic apparatus used will be both adequate as a means of analysis and appropriate as a tool for linking the characterisations of input and data language items.

{"abstract": "State-space explosion is a major obstacle in verification of time-critical distributed systems. An important factor with a negative influence on the tractability of the analysis is the size of constants that clocks are compared to. This problem is particularly accented in ex- plicit state-space exploration techniques. We suggest an approximation method for reducing the size of constants present in the model. The proposed method is developed for Timed-Arc Petri Nets and creates an under-approximation or an over-approximation of the model behaviour. The verification of approximated Petri net models can be considerably faster but it does not in general guarantee conclusive answers. We im- plement the algorithms within the open-source model checker TAPAAL and demonstrate on a number of experiments that our approximation techniques often result in a significant speed-up of the verification.", "authors": ["Sine Viesmose Birch", "Thomas Stig Jacobsen", "Jacob Jon Jensen", "Christoffer Moesgaard", "Niels N\u00f8rgaard Samuelsen", "Ji\u0159\u00ed Srba"], "n_citation": 2, "references": ["05187588-ada5-47d3-ab0d-a282be6fc447", "2230c340-e108-418b-a1ab-c40ef3eaefe5", "260b34ec-bd5e-487e-9e8a-b479dc679345", "26ba289c-7209-4d40-a7c3-3acc2bd88f65", "2a8da6cc-4c7e-480a-929b-d41ee021ccf4", "357c3e46-8be2-422d-b54f-74dbc52e0d3e", "4fccb3c3-45e6-46b9-8806-50d8451fb840", "50f10b22-b641-47ba-b594-d8af05f4c3d5", "80c5d053-0786-4d72-9cb8-a0a3217bd49e", "8512d397-7900-4842-81eb-8a7935a772df", "871abaad-e9bb-4f97-8dc5-081305d73bb9", "92d10f3d-c071-49d4-b9ee-b53151d80aa7", "9849d9c4-a97f-452f-882c-42a8c6cab0b5", "a02087e5-151c-4061-b172-7770f51f84f6", "b9406df7-db37-4dd8-83d9-90b6b1713f2d", "c45016d5-4794-4c33-a2d0-f7d30a38f9ef", "d196ebe5-517e-4423-a021-ec7206cad311", "d50cac03-25bc-47fd-9a27-2be1052bd5e9", "e2f00686-d81e-4d69-b5e3-88a9d8d2e7f9", "e67d1f2b-624c-424e-a4e0-7ba8ff810b14", "ecf23f31-b26e-45aa-8b56-674b89ef15f7", "ff3e5819-210a-4ada-b654-33a95105d77a"], "title": "Interval Abstraction Refinement for Model Checking of Timed-Arc Petri Nets", "venue": "formal modeling and analysis of timed systems", "year": 2014, "id": "03dd4db1-3540-4de6-b8f4-5d79cc538dd7"}

In this part we also discussed building an image database that can be used for evaluating steganography/steganalysis fairly.

{"abstract": "This paper presents an experimental evaluation of a rapid, adaptive assessment of the difference threshold (DL) of passive metacar- pophalangeal index finger joint flexion using a robotic device. Parameter Estimation by Sequential Testing (PEST) is compared to the method of constant stimuli (MOCS) using a two-alternative forced-choice par- adigm. The pilot study with 13 healthy subjects provided DLs within similar ranges for MOCS and PEST, averaging at 2.15 \u25e6 \u00b1 0.77 \u25e6 and 1.73 \u25e6 \u00b10.78 \u25e6 , respectively, in accordance with the literature. However, no significant correlation was found between the two methods (r(11) = 0.09, p =0 .762). The average number of trials required for PEST to converge was 58.7\u00b1 17.6, and significantly lower compared to 120 trials for MOCS ( p< 0.001), leading to an assessment time of under 15 min. These results suggest that rapid, adaptive methods, such as PEST, could be success- fully implemented in novel robotic tools for clinical assessment of sensory deficits.", "authors": ["Mike D.

{"abstract": "Entailment pairs are sentence pairs of a premise and a hypothesis, where the premise textually entails the hypothesis. Such sentence pairs are important for the development of Textual Entailment systems. In this paper, we take a closer look at a prominent strategy for their automatic acquisition from newspaper corpora, pairing first sentences of articles with their titles. We propose a simple logistic regression model that incorporates and extends this heuristic and investigate its robustness across three languages and three domains. We manage to identify two predictors which predict entailment pairs with a fairly high accuracy across all languages. However, we find that robustness across domains within a language is more difficult to achieve.", "authors": ["Manaal Faruqui", "Sebastian Pad\u00f3"], "n_citation": 3, "references": ["484d1994-e9da-477d-9be2-1f1e154cd919", "68453f24-4276-4d0c-b37e-19d23af549be", "71103b6f-e0a7-4eff-9759-b101db960813", "740934af-33dd-4725-9755-5905b5b2950b", "c3f183fc-1f5d-44a9-85c4-c81a03e89586", "c92afebe-c430-4bb8-9ef9-6a46981d2008", "f82b5743-01a4-45f3-bce7-b0ea605b77a1"], "title": "Acquiring entailment pairs across languages and domains: a data analysis", "venue": "", "year": 2011, "id": "05e535a9-2021-4393-a19e-6a0277034323"}

{"abstract": "This paper addresses an optimization-based approach for the design of RF integrated inductors. The methodology presented deals with the complexity of the design problem by formulating it as a multi-objective optimization. The multi-modal nature of the underlying functions combined with the need to be able to explore design trade-offs leads to the use of niching methods. This allows exploring not only the best trade-off solutions lying on the Pareto-optimum surface but also the quasi-optimum solutions that would be otherwise discarded. In this paper we take advantage of the niching properties of lbest PSO algorithm using ring topology to devise a simple optimizer able to find the local-optima. For the efficiency of the process analytical models are used for the passive/active devices. In spite the use of physics-based analytical expressions for the evaluation of the lumped elements, the variability of the process parameters is ignored in the optimization stage due to the significant computational burden it involves. Thus in the final stage both the Pareto- optimum solutions and the quasi-optimum solutions are evaluated with respect to the sensitivity to process parameter variations.", "authors": ["Pedro Pereira", "Fernando Vieira Coito", "M.

{"abstract": "Process-based context-aware applications are increasingly be- coming more complex and dynamic. Besides the large sets of process vari- ants to be managed in such dynamic systems, process variants need to be context sensitive in order to accommodate new user requirements and intrinsic complexity. This paradigm shift forces us to defer decisions to runtime where process variants must be customized and executed based on a recognized context. However, there exists a lack of deferral of the entire process variant configuration and execution to perform an auto- mated decision of subsequent variation points at runtime. In this paper, we present a holistic methodology to automatically resolve process vari- ability at runtime. The proposed solution performs a staged configuration considering static and dynamic context data to accomplish effective de- cision making. We demonstrate our approach by exemplifying a storage operation process in a smart logistics scenario. Our evaluation demon- strates the performance and scalability results of our methodology.", "authors": ["Aitor Murguzur", "Xabier De Carlos", "Salvador Trujillo", "Goiuria Sagardui"], "n_citation": 17, "references": ["0c44460f-f903-491d-86aa-cb9acc6195ce", "1c59b784-f37e-4f91-830a-1854c71a9d67", "1cf5d426-6fcd-4f7e-bea8-47563995fdf1", "1e262154-167f-47a4-863b-bf7090bc12f6", "2183a9e6-5c3e-40c4-9242-ea601dbcf269", "287d3a10-73c3-44b5-afc2-92b344ce55fc", "3ac62a82-475e-436d-9cb2-2ff40e7c52c2", "623f9f85-224d-4e84-83d9-f47ff6fd530a", "6f63bfe9-a11a-4ef9-9fc7-99d844d2dd1f", "74424e38-e59b-434f-b1bd-725e88efa24c", "7cd163f9-71ac-44a7-810d-0dcff00497f0", "c9cf5470-888a-434e-85a6-e27c79094a92", "d22c1316-0dec-489c-b2ae-c678666945be", "ded566c6-89e7-465d-bbfd-a5e0c4546953", "e2f91e8c-b0b9-4ce1-a8b5-e5f28893f483", "f3c71e61-e69d-4411-bda1-d63c988507b1", "fac86b5d-de78-4185-9f40-b8309796f067", "ff7adeba-edb8-4b2d-a8d4-71afaf90f285"], "title": "Context-Aware Staged Configuration of Process Variants@Runtime", "venue": "conference on advanced information systems engineering", "year": 2014, "id": "074ff4d0-27b3-4854-8996-0c7adff14ce8"}

{"abstract": "Gene tree parsimony (GTP) problems infer species supertrees from a collection of rooted gene trees that are confounded by evolutionary events like gene duplication, gene duplication and loss, and deep coalescence. These problems are NP-complete, and consequently, they often are addressed by effective local search heuristics that perform a stepwise search of the tree space, where each step is guided by an exact solution to an instance of a local search problem. Still, GTP problems require rooted input gene trees; however, in practice, most phylogenetic methods infer unrooted gene trees and it may be difficult to root correctly. In this work, we (i) define the first local NNI search problems to solve heuristically the GTP equivalents for unrooted input gene trees, called unrooted GTP problems, and (ii) describe linear time algorithms for these local search problems.

{"abstract": "We propose and show a parallel and distributed runtime environment for multi-agent systems that provides spatial agent migration ability by employing code morphing. The focus of the application scenario lies on sensor networks and low-power, resource-aware single System-On-Chip designs. An agent approach provides stronger autonomy than a traditional object or remote-procedure-call based approach. Agents can decide for themselves which actions are performed, and they are capable of reacting on the environment and other agents with flexible behaviour. Data processing nodes exchange code rather than data to transfer information. A part of the state of an agent is preserved within its own program code, which also implements the agent's migration functionality. The practicability of the approach is shown using a simple distributed Sobel filter as an example.", "authors": ["Stefan Bosse", "Florian Pantke", "Frank Kirchner"], "n_citation": 50, "references": ["a4d227fc-da17-4bd8-996d-9053c3a03e2f"], "title": "Distributed computing in sensor networks using multi-agent systems and code morphing", "venue": "international conference on artificial intelligence and soft computing", "year": 2012, "id": "07f6d4ba-fb98-4988-bf9a-79225234ea1d"}
{"abstract": "Introduction: Public health surveillance systems need to be refined. We intend to use a generic approach for early identification of patients with severe influenza-like illness (ILI) by calculating a score that estimates a patient\u2019s disease-severity. Accordingly, we built the Intelligent Severity Score Estimation Model (ISSEM), structured so that the inference process would reflect experts\u2019 decisionmaking logic. Each patient\u2019s disease-severity score is calculated from numbers of respiratory ICD9 encounters, and laboratory, radiologic, and prescription-therapeutic orders in the EMR. Other ISSEM components include chronic disease evidence, probability of immunodeficiency, and the provider\u2019s general practice-behavior patterns. Results: Sensitivity was determined from 200 randomly selected patients with upper- and lowerrespiratory tract ILI; specificity, from 300 randomly selected patients with URI only. For different age groups, ISSEM sensitivity ranged between 90% and 95%; specificity was 72% to 84%. Conclusion: Our preliminary assessment of ISSEM performance demonstrated 93.5% sensitivity and 77.3% specificity across all age groups. Background", "authors": ["Zaruhi R. Mnatsakanyan", "Daniel J.

{"abstract": "Data skewness is a challenge encountered, in particular, when apply- ing supervised machine learning approaches in various domains, such as in healthcare and biomedical information engineering. Evidence Based Medicine (EBM) is a clinical strategy for prescribing treatment based on current best evi- dence for individual patients. Clinicians need to query publication repositories in order to find the best evidence to support their decision-making processes. This sophisticated information is materialised in the form of scientific artefacts in scholarly publications and the automatic extraction of these artefacts is a technical challenge for current generic search engines. Many classification ap- proaches have been proposed for identifying key scientific artefacts in EBM, however their performance is affected by the imbalanced characteristic of data in this domain. In this paper, we present four data balancing approaches applied in a binary ensemble classifier framework for classifying scientific artefacts in the EBM domain. Our balancing approaches improve the ensemble classifier's F-score by up to 15% for classes of scientific artefacts with extremely low cov- erage in the domain. In addition, we propose a classifier selection method for choosing the best classifier based on the distributional feature of classes. The resulting classifiers show improved classification performances when compared to state of the art approaches.", "authors": ["Hamed Hassanzadeh", "Tudor Groza", "Anthony Nguyen", "Jane Hunter"], "n_citation": 3, "references": ["03299260-9046-4b00-b1f0-6fe94c6bee31", "0ce65577-0bcd-418a-990e-2866cd3d6914", "2076f2d8-e5eb-4f82-98ae-0cc80f69c0fb", "2e747b99-e8d9-4983-9e0d-8c316484dc2c", "4435e965-4037-4be0-84c8-fb12fc6e9df3", "5ccce3c6-6967-41c5-a266-1f19b9f3595f", "5e148b25-36a0-4715-b14c-08a2ea6edadc", "6f620bdf-5879-4e2e-9c2c-ab3cd2f9eff7", "9742db56-9481-414f-9f78-c8f1ad4f8688", "aee42a83-57cf-4624-8579-c1a81b2af264", "af647f42-0b8d-480b-a36e-c7f351a95473"], "title": "Load Balancing for Imbalanced Data Sets: Classifying Scientific Artefacts for Evidence Based Medicine", "venue": "pacific rim international conference on artificial intelligence", "year": 2014, "id": "08633eb6-25d0-45c7-b2c3-219e0b7248a4"}

For example, they are vital to banking applications, communication of electronic systems, air traf\ufb01c control, manufacturing automation, biomedical operation works, space monitoring systems and robotics information systems. As the nature of computing comes to be increasingly directed towards intelligence and autonomy, intelligent computations will be the key for all future applications. Intelligent distributed computing will become the base for the growth of an innovative generation of intelligent distributed systems. Nowadays, research centres require the development of architectures of intelligent and collaborated systems; these systems must be capable of solving problems by themselves to save processing time and reduce costs. Building an intelligent style of distributed computing that controls the whole distributed system requires communications that must be based on a completely consistent system. The model of the ideal system to be adopted in building an intelligent distributed computing structure is the human body system, speci\ufb01cally the body\u2019s cells.

{"abstract": "In this paper we re-examine the well known problem of asynchronous black hole search in a ring. It is well known that at least 2 agents are needed and the total number of agents' moves is at least \u03a9(n log n); solutions indeed exist that allow a team of two agents to locate the black hole with the asymptotically optimal cost of \u0398(n log n) moves.#R##N##R##N#In this paper we first of all determine the exact move complexity of black hole search in an asynchronous ring. In fact, we prove that 3n log3 n-O(n) moves are necessary. We then present a novel algorithm that allows two agents to locate the black hole with at most 3n log3 n + O(n) moves, improving the existing upper bounds, and matching the lower bound up to the constant of proportionality. Finally we show how to modify the protocol so to achieve asymptotically optimal time complexity \u0398(n), still with 3n log3 n + O(n) moves; this improves upon all existing time-optimal protocols, which require O(n2) moves. This protocol is the first that is optimal with respect to all three complexity measures: size (number of agents), cost (number of moves) and time; in particular, its cost and size complexities match the lower bounds up to the constant.", "authors": ["Balasingham Balamohan", "Paola Flocchini", "Ali Miri", "Nicola Santoro"], "n_citation": 10, "references": ["084fdbdf-147e-40c9-bbde-3f402e70aee0", "0863919a-7f04-422f-a3fb-f32451886d06", "0e34dac8-fbb0-45e1-95e3-351b3f4489a1", "14e44f98-d133-4f6e-b27e-9cb770fdb68d", "1fe312d0-b1bb-495d-add2-cfc74dd7fee8", "28fd05bd-40c6-4449-b2d8-f7043e45540e", "29292e0c-b4ca-440f-bb34-9244f4ee91ae", "2ed9dca1-26a1-438d-9991-f7e1ab3f569d", "4835d03a-3f83-46cc-a273-381200f612f0", "538d2009-f810-495d-a30e-d626ba893ca9", "723c59a7-9faf-4b3b-bb66-ff250e5414f8", "74968918-a562-4a00-9531-a9cde2e55879", "80abf684-d4b9-4b6b-be8e-bef94437484c", "842f4121-d4c4-4e30-b71e-21157f999234", "8c319c10-0b45-4807-b0ea-e034107df31f", "8f1f4c71-0ba2-4407-99ce-b6fe0e1b9697", "bca41329-1f39-4929-957d-581675aa24a1", "e87a9331-c89b-4d5b-a754-952477b7ab10", "eeb4b412-6675-4db7-890e-03913c9774ed", "fa6e1cca-0703-4229-803d-274ee88f7b81"], "title": "Improving the optimal bounds for black hole search in rings", "venue": "", "year": 2011, "id": "08785973-8224-40f9-bf67-324cfb78238b"}

Semantic analysis of questions is performed in order to extract key word used in retrieval queries and to detect the expected answer type. Semantic analysis of retrieved paragraphs includes checking the presence of entities of the expected answer type and extracting logical relations between words. A paragraph is considered to justify an answer if similar relations are present in the question.

On one hand, issues of continuous wireless connectivity and mobility management must be solved in future heterogeneous mobile Internet architectures with ever growing traffic demands. On the other hand, Quality of Service (QoS) and Quality of Experience (QoE) must be guaranteed in a reliable, robust and diagnostically acceptable way.

{"abstract": "Utilization of camera systems for surveillance tasks (e. g. traffic monitoring) has become a standard procedure and has been in use for over 20 years. However, most of the cameras are operated locally and data analyzed manually. Locally means here a limited field of view and that the image sequences are processed independently from other cameras. For the enlargement of the observation area and to avoid occlusions and non-accessible areas multiple camera systems with overlapping and non-overlapping cameras are used. The joint processing of image sequences of a multi-camera system is a scientific and technical challenge. The processing is divided traditionally into camera calibration, object detection, tracking and interpretation. The fusion of information from different cameras is carried out in the world coordinate system. To reduce the network load, a distributed processing concept can be implemented.#R##N##R##N#Object detection and tracking are fundamental image processing tasks for scene evaluation. Situation assessments are based mainly on characteristic local movement patterns (e.g. directions and speed), from which trajectories are derived. It is possible to recognize atypical movement patterns of each detected object by comparing local properties of the trajectories. Interaction of different objects can also be predicted with an additional classification algorithm.#R##N##R##N#This presentation discusses trajectory based recognition algorithms for atypical event detection in multi object scenes to obtain area based types of information (e.g. maps of speed patterns, trajectory curvatures or erratic movements) and shows that two-dimensional areal data analysis of moving objects with multiple cameras offers new possibilities for situational analysis.", "authors": ["Ralf Reulke", "Dominik Rue\u00df", "Kristian Manthey", "Andreas Luber"], "n_citation": 1, "references": ["0fd21eb3-a0fa-47df-81b3-3decd40e7f41", "11b36e1c-c93b-4e12-820c-30e43cca673c", "27afbfc7-d29a-4061-a67b-d8e124bf3f7c", "2a8729d8-0911-4ea6-88d1-17bd24e53aa1", "2d479dbc-9e18-4ea1-8b70-eaacb0b06b7a", "34b61f45-4695-404b-b59f-d9ff4d0d4a0f", "4deecabf-7a1b-44ee-870d-237d7fcf925c", "60285266-7da2-474e-b05a-b380c836f665", "7802ebdc-6e4c-4501-b1cf-899ad51c0c1a", "91979159-37d8-410f-a245-a33ef80a092b", "947c177a-cdcd-42c1-9999-3bf5f5811735", "94e708cf-5cf4-40f2-bc87-1ac8ddb6bef9", "9775a0d7-bf2c-4dcc-8682-5cabeabd33c7", "a2a72c14-fed4-47f1-b913-c97119529fb0", "a941db08-2328-441a-9f7a-f52dd000fec9", "ac2a8c3c-cb85-487e-80d0-937f17959002", "c98c332d-0aa7-4c94-a3fe-3f131e2fdb7a", "c9fa31f7-f6ce-49ea-b42c-8d03ae59dbe4", "e0a4505e-ceb4-47ec-8c95-8b22c07cb53b", "ebfca554-7a3c-4597-954b-07336a2e3030", "ed1f198d-d98c-4cee-a565-286ae5d4801b"], "title": "Traffic observation and situation assessment", "venue": "international conference on computer vision", "year": 2011, "id": "0a89c062-028f-43bf-a2cb-92e54f0b4d72"}

Today's Web was designed primarily for human use. To enable reliable, large-scale automated interoperation of services by computer programs or agents, the properties, capabilities, interfaces and effects of Web services must be understandable to computers. In this paper we propose a vision and a partial realization of precisely this. We propose markup of Web services in the DAML family of semantic Web markup languages.

{"abstract": "In this chapter, I discuss my experiences applying Problem-Based Learn- ing to technical IT courses such as mathematics and computer application design and programming. One of the hallmarks of nearly any technical concentration is a critical need to develop strong individual, and typically challenging, technical skill sets early in the program, and high dependence on these skill sets in later courses, internships, and ultimately professional work or graduate studies. Another hallmark of the IT field is a need for strong metacognitive skills to analyze complex scenarios and the ability to creatively use their technical skill sets to synthesize new solutions and create working systems, much like an artist creates new works. The chapter is a reflection of how I try to: (1) Structure early courses to help stu- dents rapidly gain difficult technical skill sets without crushing their will to contin- ue as a result of harsh weed-out techniques, but at the same time rigorously demand and assess progress; (2) Balance conflicts between the desire for rapid and efficient assessment versus the need for detailed and careful assessment that avoids gaming of the assessment system by students; (3) Gradually push technical students away from memorize-and-regurgitate learning approaches and towards an independent learning model; and (4) Help students make the transition from early individual- ized skill set development to wider-scale analysis and creative synthesis of complex systems.", "authors": ["David R.

{"abstract": "It is well known that, as the dimensionality of a metric space increases, metric search techniques become less effective and the cost of indexing mechanisms becomes greater than the saving they give. This is due to the so-called curse of dimensionality. One effect of increasing dimensionality is that the ratio of unit hypersphere to unit hypercube volume decreases rapidly, making the solution to a similarity query (the query ball, or hypersphere) ever more difficult to identify by using metric invariants such as triangle inequality. In this paper we take a different approach, by identifying points within a query polyhedron rather than a ball. We show how this can be achieved by constructing a surrogate metric space, such that a query ball in the surrogate space corresponds to a polyhedron in the original space. If the polyhedron contains the ball, the overall cost of the query is likely to be increased in high dimensions; however, we show that shrinking the polyhedron can capture a surprisingly high proportion of the points within the ball, whilst at the same time giving a more efficient, and more scalable, search. We show results which confirm our underlying hypothesis. In some cases we can retrieve significant volumes of query results from spaces which are otherwise intractable.", "authors": ["Richard C. H.

This paper presents an artificial intelligence approach to automatically construct annotation pipelines for given information needs and quality prioritizations. Based on an abstract ontological model, we use partial order planning to select a pipeline's algorithms and informed search to obtain an efficient pipeline schedule. We realized the approach as an expert system on top of Apache UIMA, which offers evidence that pipelines can be constructed ad-hoc in near-zero time.", "authors": ["Henning Wachsmuth", "Mirko Rose", "Gregor Engels"], "n_citation": 5, "references": ["03f4361e-e252-46f0-a6b3-766a35cc16ca", "0a72fadc-7a2e-43f7-b2e3-21a5a7ec0d1e", "380ce983-19cd-4292-b741-18dd02768964", "4fe39d4a-0427-4878-b585-30c1f75fcb8a", "57a70ffc-e3b7-4547-adae-d59e12c9e50d", "640c2316-b195-44b9-9e82-18db188130ef", "6e0e444a-a974-4d7d-8166-368cd702dc37", "837f98b0-21a8-4cd4-863e-071dda1fa615", "88591ede-7bf5-44a8-8b8a-30d311bb886b", "89c4c986-221a-4ed8-b8bb-30499c84d53b", "b5f74013-faee-4012-b503-90408f4cea95", "c82ee9a9-fe7d-44bb-aafb-96173675eec8", "d8b485d0-701b-447f-880b-2908f6e2f8cd", "eeee0b01-dd70-4c8d-862a-104194bcf04b", "fd84301d-d771-4cc8-8b57-56b9692dad38", "fea77781-83eb-466e-86bc-0515f2dc85d3", "ffad9620-16a2-4b48-ad28-bebfc84686a6"], "title": "Automatic pipeline construction for real-time annotation", "venue": "international conference on computational linguistics", "year": 2013, "id": "0e08de32-0004-40d3-8d99-ea9713f79aae"}

{"abstract": "Accurately locating users in a wireless environment is an important task for many pervasive computing and AI applications, such as activity recognition. In a WiFi environment, a mobile device can be localized using signals received from various transmitters, such as access points (APs). Most localization approaches build a map between the signal space and the physical location space in a offline phase, and then using the received-signal-strength (RSS) map to estimate the location in an online phase. However, the map can be outdated when the signal-strength values change with time due to environmental dynamics. It is infeasible or expensive to repeat data calibration for reconstructing the RSS map. In such a case, it is important to adapt the model learnt in one time period to another time period without too much recalibration. In this paper, we present a location-estimation approach based on Manifold co-Regularization, which is a machine learning technique for building a mapping function between data. We describe LeManCoR, a system for adapting the mapping function between the signal space and physical location space over different time periods based on Manifold Co-Regularization. We show that LeManCoR can effectively transfer the knowledge between two time periods without requiring too much new calibration effort.

{"abstract": "Knowledge of how a science data product has been generated is a critical component to determining its fitness-for-use for a given analysis. One objective of science information systems is to allow users to search for data products based on a wide range of criteria; spatial and temporal extent, observed parameter, research domain, and organizational project are common search criteria. Currently, science information systems are geared towards helping users find data, but not in helping users determine how the products were generated. An information system that exposes the provenance of available data products, that is what observations, assumptions, and science processing were involved in the generation of the data products, would contribute significant benefit to user fitness-for-use decision-making.#R##N##R##N#In this work we discuss semantics-driven provenance extensions to the Virtual Solar Terrestrial Observatory (VSTO) information system. The VSTO semantic web portal uses an ontology to provide a unified search and product retrieval interface to data in the fields of solar, solar-terrestrial, and space physics. We have developed an extension to the VSTO ontology that allows it to express item-level data product records. We will show how the Open Provenance Model (OPM) and the Proof Markup Language (PML) can be used to express the provenance of data product records. Additionally, we will discuss ways in which domain semantics can aid in the formulation - and answering - of provenance queries.

{"abstract": "This study is focused on querying accomplished on structured spaces of information. Querying is understood in terms of mining structures of information and of knowledge understanding. We consider information as a subject of descriptions expressed in some language. Information is hidden behind such descriptions. Operations done on structured spaces of information are performed on language constructions describing such structures. However, automatic operations not always can be performed directly on language constructions. In such cases it is necessary to expand performance to the space of information. The study concerns paginated (i.e. printed and handwritten) music notation. It is shown that querying in the space of music information requires syntactic structuring as well as its expansion to semantic analysis. It is worth underlining that data understanding requires analysis of uncertainty: analyzed data are usually incomplete, uncertain and with some incorrectness. Such imperfectness of information is hidden under the level of syntax and semantics. Due to limitation of the paper this problem is not studied.", "authors": ["Wladyslaw Homenda", "Mariusz Rybnik"], "n_citation": 5, "references": ["0ebb0b84-824a-47c4-8daf-3ef005e1aafc", "1a4c73cc-532a-42f0-bb59-0489f33c9640", "1dd6aa6d-f794-4153-85e9-84b626cf49f2", "7f1cde3b-b069-4245-8dbb-510cf42974f7", "b60d309d-11f0-424e-8ad0-db741eabb70d", "ee80ce42-8969-4006-b0e3-1fa8f69c69d1"], "title": "Querying in spaces of music information", "venue": "", "year": 2011, "id": "0f27b0a9-4520-44e7-a589-4b9ab4248821"}
{"abstract": "Agriculture is the dominant sector in the Ethiopian economy but it is characterized by low productivity. Ethiopia is interested in creating access to agricultural knowledge through an agricultural knowledge management system (AKMS). Such a system has been developed using a web-based portal named Ethiopian Agriculture Portal (EAP). It is facilitated through Woreda Knowledge Centers (WKCs) which are in 10 Pilot Learning Woredas (PLW). Providing knowledge in the appropriate format, identification of affordable technological infrastructure, and integrating indigenous agricultural knowledge into the knowledge system is vital to empowering development agents (extension workers) in Ethiopia. This study addresses two research questions: 1)To what extent does the centralized AKMS support WKCs access and utilization of agricultural knowledge? 2) How can the existing AKMS support capturing and sharing of indigenous agricultural knowledge and best practices?", "authors": ["Monica J.

{"abstract": "It has been widely observed that different NLP applications require different sense granularities in order to best exploit word sense distinctions, and that for many applications WordNet senses are too fine-grained. In contrast to previously proposed automatic methods for sense clustering, we formulate sense merging as a supervised learning problem, exploiting human-labeled sense clusterings as training data. We train a discriminative classifier over a wide variety of features derived from WordNet structure, corpus-based evidence, and evidence from other lexical resources. Our learned similarity measure outperforms previously proposed automatic methods for sense clustering on the task of predicting human sense merging judgments, yielding an absolute F-score improvement of 4.1% on nouns, 13.6% on verbs, and 4.0% on adjectives. Finally, we propose a model for clustering sense taxonomies using the outputs of our classifier, and we make available several automatically sense-clustered WordNets of various sense granularities.", "authors": ["Rion Snow", "Sushant Prakash", "Daniel Jurafsky", "Andrew Y.

{"abstract": "Patch management of networks is essential to mitigate the risks from the exploitation of vulnerabilities through malware and other attacks, but by set- ting too rigorous a patching policy for network devices the IT security team can also create burdens for IT operations or disruptions to the business. Different patch deployment timelines could be adopted with the aim of reducing this op- erational cost, but care must be taken not to substantially increase the risk of emergency disruption from potential exploits and attacks. In this paper we ex- plore how the IT security policy choices regarding patching timelines can be made in terms of economically-based decisions, in which the aim is to minimize the expected overall costs to the organization from patching-related activity. We introduce a simple cost function that takes into account costs incurred from dis- ruption caused by planned patching and from expected disruption caused by emergency patching. To explore the outcomes under different patching policies we apply a systems modelling approach and Monte Carlo style simulations. The results from the simulations show disruptions caused for a range of patch dep- loyment timelines. These results together with the cost function are then used to identify the optimal patching timelines under different threat environment con- ditions and taking into account the organization's risk tolerance.", "authors": ["Yolanta Beres", "Jonathan Griffin"], "n_citation": 50, "references": ["05db0573-9e8e-4144-a1cf-996b6b2eece6", "1fa9751a-1578-430a-96b2-e513439ec70a", "2fcee12b-62d3-419d-80f7-4a491438fad9", "379f4c41-3cab-4b95-bacd-17f8a49ace43", "5baa351c-3a76-4a21-b499-a81f048b628c", "bca6d5e8-c1e9-4180-b551-cfc6e3ba6ac4"], "title": "Optimizing Network Patching Policy Decisions", "venue": "information security", "year": 2012, "id": "0f6f82ba-6712-4985-a9cb-11ebbb388dbd"}

The goal of the work is to support computer-enhanced distance collaboration, where domain-specific recognizers handle different kinds of digital ink input and editing. The first of these recognizers is for mathematics, which allows converting math input into machine-understandable format.

{"abstract": "One of the goals of translational science is to shorten the time from discovery to clinical use. Clinical trial registries were established to increase transparency in completed and ongoing clinical trials, and they support linking trials with resulting publications. We set out to investigate precision and negative predictive value (NPV) of links between ClinicalTrials.gov (CT.gov) and PubMed. CT.gov has been established to increase transparency in clinical trials and the link to PubMed is crucial for supporting a number of important functions, including ascertaining publication bias. We drew a random sample of trials downloaded from CT.gov and performed manual review of retrieved publications. We characterize two types of links between trials and publications (NCT-link originating from MEDLINE and PMID-link originating from CT.gov).The link precision is different based on type (NCT-link: 100%; PMID-link: 63% to 96%). In trials with no linked publication, we were able to find publications 44% of the time (NPV=56%) by searching PubMed. This low NPV shows that there are potentially numerous publications that should have been formally linked with the trials.

{"abstract": "In previous works a novel flexible and versatile handling concept, called PARAGRIP(Parallel Gripping), was introduced. This concept is based ona reconfigurable architecture with a modular and alterable layout. The robot system is able to handle objects with six DOF by forming a parallel kinematic structure including several robotic arms and the object itself. As many kinematic parameters, like the grasp- and base-points of the arms as well as the arm combination can be designed freely, the handling system offers a fast and economic possibility to adapt the performances to the requirements of the task. This adaption can proceed before or even during manipulation. The latter is realized by dynamic re-grasping, where the object is passed from one arm to the next, if more than three arms are available in the layout.#R##N##R##N#This Paper deals with the question how an optimal configuration set can be planned automatically, if the robot layout offers the possibility of dynamic re-grasping.

{"abstract": "Business processes are recognized by organizations as one of the most important intangible assets, since they let organizations improve their competitiveness. Business processes are supported by enterprise information systems, which can evolve over time and embed particular business rules that are not present anywhere else. Thus, there are many organizations with inaccurate business processes, which prevent the modernization of enterprise information systems in line with the business processes that they support. Therefore, business process mining techniques are often used to retrieve reliable business processes from the event logs recorded during the execution of enterprise systems. Unfortunately, such event logs are represented with purpose-specific notations such as Mining XML and still don't apply the recent software modernization standard: ISO 19506 (KDM, Knowledge Discovery Metamodel). This paper presents an exogenous model transformation between these two notations. The main advantage is that process mining techniques can be effectively reused within software modernization projects according to the standard notation. This paper is particularly focused on the empirical evaluation of this transformation by simulating different kinds of business process models and several event logs with different sizes and configurations from such models. After analyzing all the model transformation executions, the study demonstrates that the transformation can provide suitable KDM models in a linear time in accordance with the size of the input models.", "authors": ["Mar\u00eda Fern\u00e1ndez-Ropero", "Ricardo P\u00e9rez-Castillo", "Barbara Weber", "Mario Piattini"], "n_citation": 4, "references": ["08e139c7-baf8-4ed3-a927-31c62d2a5a5c", "0a565bab-0582-425b-bc05-84441a637b23", "0f4e538e-9062-45be-af32-49466c4d3e39", "3b7888ce-f0ad-4f99-a8b9-a2091f9f3096", "40cea306-08e1-4228-abb5-2051a463ced6", "4185a249-a450-48bc-bf2c-94d7b86cc862", "4a7f8af0-c721-4958-9043-0d9ba37ad064", "51e2a1cd-ea17-4040-95bd-1a036b58213d", "6519f146-d16f-4912-8d95-3a67c1ae8625", "659063dd-f2d7-491a-a83c-d372beabc85b", "73a51074-5f46-41b5-a271-d5b1a3176206", "873aac9a-7ae4-44d7-a9be-b03a4453f473", "9d90c20c-6d4c-45a3-8388-977099a2abd1", "b409eb3e-db34-49a4-99d5-48e6edb05eb6", "b7a2ec6b-8ba0-43e1-9834-be800dbfcac4", "b8c3a82f-79fa-4397-90df-20ae83158e7a", "c284d49e-c5dc-47be-816f-ac804c862de6", "d532c8e3-647b-4b28-848f-e891f6861754"], "title": "Empirical assessment of business model transformations based on model simulation", "venue": "international conference on model transformation", "year": 2012, "id": "10de5912-723f-4edc-8d3f-5fc723169498"}

{"abstract": "In the domain of ontology design as well as in Knowledge Representation, modeling universals is a challenging problem. Most approaches that have addressed this problem rely on Description Logics (DLs) but many difficulties remain , due to under-constrained representation which reduces the inferences that can be drawn and further causes problems in expressiveness. In mathematical logic and program checking, type theories have proved to be appealing but, so far they have not been applied in the formalization of ontologies. To bridge this gap, we present in this paper a theory for representing ontologies in a de pendently- typed framework which relies on strong formal foundations including both a constructive logic and a functional type system. The language of this theory defines in a precise way what ontol ogical primitives such as classes, relations, properties, etc., and thereof roles, are. The first part of the paper details how the se primitives are defined and used within the theory. In a seco nd part, we focus on the formalization of the role primitive. A review of significant role properties leads to the specificati on of a role profile and most of the remaining work details through nu merous examples, how the proposed theory is able to fully satisfy this profile. It is demonstrated that dependent types can mod el several non-trivial aspects of roles including a formal s olution for generalization hierarchies, identity criteria for roles a nd other contributions. A discussion is given on how the theory is able to cope with many of the constraints inherent in a good role representation.", "authors": ["Patrick Barlatier", "Richard Dapoigny"], "n_citation": 50, "references": ["02820152-4296-4e06-9104-ce4a54b6dca3", "04edcaec-b50d-41a4-88ef-e44f78341d95", "0606831b-4490-4f0e-9a17-429fdae696fd", "07ec78ab-3d0f-4581-b778-ccc356f6fd46", "08960518-5fb7-408b-a812-43e935face3b", "0c57c1fc-b8b7-469a-bd8b-8056ba72632b", "0d5f2eae-f748-4286-8f63-9bcc43f3aaa3", "119c95bf-d999-4f7f-bf23-123a7794abaa", "1c906634-46e9-4bc6-9cbe-3cb57ffb5a28", "23af7984-1394-4270-84a2-1b01b35dabfc", "2c6ba557-37e1-46e8-b108-0631fe1ca4f2", "350df4f6-ddf7-46a0-a5fc-e680da21423f", "35ae8959-22a6-45c5-b5f9-51bb6342d8d6", "40ab296a-db74-419c-a81b-e016d4929199", "42ea6086-62ba-4bfa-b59c-4e454c848818", "43df1764-f766-4e24-b765-0dd6a26fd1bc", "45ec0bdb-6e26-4bbd-a311-b410ae947445", "48a31150-e17c-4ded-a124-f1fbca300338", "534622c5-a19e-48d8-9253-521f321c3d23", "53abf736-2a17-47c4-82cf-7f6d5ea31337", "5447b29f-87ab-4256-8928-23ee3120297c", "57edf159-2cc8-44d7-a1da-5b03c0e744db", "5c32b10a-de2f-4e89-8651-a5235a68863a", "6832defa-3186-470b-8d8b-2509416a6802", "6f21d24f-8227-4c35-87c3-47b7a664d763", "747598a7-0b4e-4f5d-89de-2bc5db2c639d", "7abd6364-bb52-4041-99be-2ae330b8731e", "8028aecc-1569-49ea-b319-6726105a93ee", "80a4bf7a-2283-4b7e-8b17-33cf6b1bb0af", "822b3043-dbf8-4b4f-a7bc-243b39b4149a", "84a66ce3-6c67-4839-b3f8-9d627f1a1d36", "84da7a7f-33b9-4a69-aeed-550aeed4d015", "8907ca33-433c-4750-9212-540abcd9284d", "8a19d900-fb03-418a-a54c-186f23bf8621", "8aa3fa57-36ab-4b19-8bc1-fabe568e1526", "8cf80590-eba6-4709-b017-8bdb970839f2", "8f20541f-b2be-4dac-ae1f-bf137e388abc", "9328c443-f08b-48cc-be07-c5bbe802a1b3", "953cb449-ec71-45ad-a063-43f2cdccacc3", "96406430-a308-44da-ace7-f8e902560001", "a52c089c-9222-4085-91c7-93b217adc8a8", "a6c13b12-6562-42b8-8062-8ff08ac1dcdb", "a9b12a52-7ec0-4a9b-b3b2-1065df9fe78d", "aac42eb9-c856-47c1-b3c7-b5cbbd8b47db", "ad9def37-73cd-4e06-8a51-49a1dfd3b0a8", "af96fd5a-b78a-4424-8e12-a854988fef6a", "b41b51ad-9aae-49d2-b2ab-a2a73a6d1b8b", "c5b4c9f2-a58e-4110-9f65-af0ddad21c6c", "c8fc9f4a-4004-4f82-850b-a70cb7f24b74", "cac3fade-381c-4f94-9b19-b3d6aa0553c4", "d4f5860d-0fa6-4ffd-b940-b0773b27b0ad", "d84ee860-5736-4169-a73e-caaa37d2ed62", "dfaefc6b-783d-4a23-a25a-f2236b033467", "e7fda079-9f7c-4f1d-a889-aaaebbad668d", "e8529a4e-7df7-405f-9ea3-30ff0d1261a1", "ec02bd03-1909-4362-a565-fd08669a8c67", "ecfb2022-e18c-4e5e-8733-d8bc6f4c8fc9", "f67b5f23-8c2d-45f7-b82d-8b52350668eb", "fa84ddb9-42f4-4b55-95a3-2d40e493c852", "ff259fbc-bf17-4de5-81dd-b624ba957170", "ff9769f1-5d32-432b-9213-f8b38dea912b"], "title": "A type-theoretical approach for ontologies: The case of roles", "venue": "Applied Ontology", "year": 2012, "id": "11755fa7-5aa6-4a90-ad8d-931db56eb3df"}

The proposed method based on the edge sensing technique improves the interpolation performance by adopting the color difference model for a green channel as well as a red/blue channel. In particular, the green channel interpolation method with a new concept includes the gradient operator, which uses the total amount of slope changes in adjacent color information, and the missing green color estimation, which uses Approximated Directional Line Averages. Comparing with various comparative experiments between the conventional results and the proposed ones, the performances of the proposed method in this paper outperform to existing algorithms in terms of visual performance both in numerical and visual aspects.

Genetic algorithms appear to be useful for solving such problems when dealing with nonlinear, large-scale systems.

{"abstract": "The gulf separating the real-time research, product development, and application development communities appears to be the largest in the entire computing field. This gulf has an unfortunate tendency to obscure the research opportunities of most value to the real-time application domains. It is an unsurprising consequence of factors historically intrinsic to each of those communities.Almost all academic, and much industrial, research in the area of real-time computing - and especially distributed real-time computing - suffers from two handicaps. First is the necessity for unusually extensive application domain-specific knowledge and understanding compared with what is required in most other computer science and engineering research. Second is the directly contrary reality that few real-time researchers have the option of obtaining such knowledge and understanding, because they lack access to non-trivial, deployed, real-time application environments - particularly to distributed ones (e.g., in process control or discrete manufacturing plants, defense systems, telecommunication intelligent network architectures) - and to the developers and users of those environments.The real-time application domain practitioners (real-time computer product and application developers and users) contribute to this gulf as well. First, the historical focus on traditional small, static, centralized, sampled-data subsystems has often subjected real-time computers to severe constraints on hardware cost, size, weight, and power. And although software development and maintenance costs per line of source code are generally one or two orders of magnitude greater for real-time software than for non-real-time software, the smallest scale instances of these subsystems actually have negligible costs for software compared with hardware. These two factors tend to discourage many of the application developers and users from believing that they need or can afford technology advances from the software and real-time research communities. Second, hardware parsimony makes it necessary, and application simplicity makes it possible, for the application programmers to do the majority of the system's resource management - most of it a' priori, and as little as possible at run time.The increasing importance and deployment of larger scale, more complex, more distributed real-time computer systems makes this gulf an increasingly greater obstacle to their cost-effectiveness and even viability. The purpose of this session is to assist in reducing this gulf by bringing to ISORC2K's researcher audience some of the most prominent visionaries in some of real-time computing's most important application domains.", "authors": ["E.

EFES reduces the dependence upon modeling specialists, and thus, makes models, both analytical and simulation, more accessible to decision-makers.

{"abstract": "The morphological changes of the vertebrae associated with normal aging are still subject of debate, whereas this knowledge is important in detecting vertebral fractures and degenerative shape changes. The aim of this study is to present a method to statistically analyze the vertebral shape and determining the morphometric changes related to normal aging. The analysis is performed on the L2 lumbar vertebrae from a large dataset of Computed Tomography scans. The surface meshes of all vertebrae, with a groupwise vertex correspondence between them, are first acquired by an intensity based registration process onto a segmented reference. Principal component analysis then reduces the dimensionality to the main modes of variation which were subsequently analyzed by multiple linear regression to acquire the global shape variations with respect to the age of the subjects. In addition, the correlation with age of the deformation at each mesh vertex is analyzed, giving a significance map of the age related changes. This analysis shows several shape changes which are in agreement with previous studies while also giving a more detailed global shape analysis. Understanding the normal shape changes allows for a better diagnosis of vertebral fractures and spinal pathologies.", "authors": ["Tristan Whitmarsh", "Luis Miguel del R\u00edo Barquero", "Silvana Di Gregorio", "Jorge Malouf Sierra", "Ludovic Humbert", "Alejandro F.

{"abstract": "Multiple datasets that add high value to biomedical research have been exposed on the web as a part of the Life Sciences Linked Open Data (LSLOD) Cloud. The ability to easily navigate through these datasets is crucial for personalized medicine and the improvement of drug discovery process. However, navigating these multiple datasets is not trivial as most of these are only available as isolated SPARQL endpoints with very little vocabulary reuse. The content that is indexed through these endpoints is scarce, making the indexed dataset opaque for users. In this paper, we propose an approach for the creation of an active Linked Life Sciences Data Roadmap, a set of congurable rules which can be used to discover links (roads) between biological entities (cities) in the LSLOD cloud. We have catalogued and linked concepts and properties from 137 public SPARQL endpoints. Our Roadmap is primarily used to dynamically assemble queries retrieving data from multiple SPARQL endpoints simultaneously. We also demonstrate its use in conjunction with other tools for selective SPARQL querying, semantic annotation of experimental datasets and the visualization of the LSLOD cloud. We have evaluated the performance of our approach in terms of the time taken and entity capture. Our approach, if generalized to encompass other domains, can be used for road-mapping the entire LOD cloud.", "authors": ["Ali Hasnain", "Syeda Sana e Zainab", "Maulik R.

{"abstract": "In recent years the plunging costs of sensors/storage have made it possible to obtain vast amounts of medical telemetry, both in clinical settings and more recently, even in patient's own homes. However for this data to be useful, it must be annotated. This annotation, requiring the attention of medical experts is very expen- sive and time consuming, and remains the critical bottleneck in medical analysis. The technique of Semi-supervised learning is the obvious way to reduce the need for human labor, however, most such algorithms are designed for intrinsically discrete objects such as graphs or strings, and do not work well in this domain, which requires the ability to deal with real-valued objects arriving in a streaming fashion. In this work we make two contributions. First, we demonstrate that in many cases a sur- prisingly small set of human annotated examples are sufficient to perform accurate classification. Second, we devise a novel parameter-free stopping criterion for semi- supervised learning. We evaluate our work with a comprehensive set of experiments on diverse medical data sources including electrocardiograms. Our experimental results suggest that our approach can typically construct accurate classifiers even if given only a single annotated instance.", "authors": ["Nurjahan Begum", "Bing Hu 0001", "Thanawin Rakthanmanon", "Eamonn J.

{"abstract": "E-learning management systems use an interactive approach that presents the learner with learning objects to interact with during the learning process. Several interactive platforms for sharing learners' ideas, integrating mutual knowledge or providing feedback have been proposed. However, these approaches have met with limited success. Furthermore, although design education is already taking full advantage of the current state and economy of online information, online teaching materials suffer from scanty content, poor interactivity, and insufficient participation. This paper proposes an interactive agent-based approach to real-time feedback (IAARF) generation in e-learning systems for higher institutions of learning. This approach presents the possible way to use agents in an interactive manner to create learner profiles, guide the learners to set the learning goals, learner activities, and extract learner resources during the learning process. The major strength of this approach is the high level of learner engagement, with real-time feedback (RF) to the learner, shaping and transforming their learning dynamics.", "authors": ["Godfrey Omoda-Onyait", "Jude T.

Traditionally incomprehensible models such as artificial neural networks presents a problem in its application to safety critical domains where not only accuracy but also model transparency is a requirement.

Furthermore, the aspect of diversity by which ensembles achieve improved classification ability cannot be reflected in rule extraction methods designed for single neural networks hence the need for rule extraction methods specifically designed for ensembles.

{"abstract": "Automated image interpretation is an important task with numerous applications. Until recently, designing such systems required extensive subject matter and computer vision expertise resulting in poor cross-domain portability and expensive maintenance. Recently, a machine-learned system (ADORE) was successfully applied in an aerial image interpretation domain. Subsequently, it was re-trained for another man-made object recognition task. In this paper we propose and implement several extensions of ADORE addressing its primary limitations. These extensions enable the first successful application of this emerging AI technology to a natural image interpretation domain.

On the other hand, people are often followed by unknown and anonymous users and are sometimes shown tweets of unknown users through the tweets of the users they follow.

This paper proposes a system for visualizing impression-based preferences of Twitter users to help people select whom to follow. The impression-based preference of a user is derived based on the impressions of the tweets the user has posted and those of the tweets of users followed by the user under consideration.

This research-in-progress is based in an innovative youth mental health service in Australia. It presents a model for a web-based platform which provides support for relapse prevention in young people with first-episode psychosis (FEP). This study combines Information Systems and Psychology theory and research to develop an advanced web-based interactive psychosocial intervention for relapse prevention and recovery in FEP. While web-based applications to support schizophrenia, depression and anxiety have been researched such approaches have not been applied to the problem of relapse prevention in young people with FEP. The research uses focus groups to study case managers, clients of the support organisation and usability experts to inform an initial prototype which has then been presented to a group of clients for evaluation.

{"abstract": "Correlated patterns are an important class of regularities that exist in a database. The all-confidence measure has been widely used to discover the patterns in real-world applications. This paper theoretically analyzes the all-confidence measure, and shows that, although the measure satisfies the null-invariant property, mining correlated patterns involving both frequent and rare items with a single minimum all-confidence (minAllConf) threshold value causes the \"rare item problem\" if the items' frequencies in a database vary widely. The problem involves either finding very short length correlated patterns involving rare items at a high minAllConf threshold, or generating a huge number of patterns at a low minAllConf threshold. The cause for the problem is that the single minAllConf threshold was not sufficient to capture the items' frequencies in a database effectively. The paper also introduces an alternative model of correlated patterns using the concept of multiple minAllConf thresholds. The proposed model facilitates the user to specify a different minAllConf threshold for each pattern to reflect the varied frequencies of items within it. Experiment results show that the proposed model is very effective.", "authors": ["R.

{"abstract": "The number of mobile phone users has been steadily increasing due to the development of microtechnology and human needs for ubiquitous communication. Menu design features play a significant role in cell phone design from the perspective of customer satisfaction. Moreover, small screens of the type used on mobile phones are limited in the amount of available space. Therefore, it is important to obtain good menu design. Review of previous menu design studies for human-computer interaction suggests that design guidelines for mobile phones need to be reappraised, especially 3D display features. We propose a conceptual model for cell phone menu design with 3D displays. The three main factors included in the model are: the number of items, task complexity, and task type.", "authors": ["Kyungdoh Kim", "Robert W.

Considering this observation we present a generalised method for reduction of decision table for different choice values of ? and s, ? being for condition attributes and s for decision attributes where ?, s ?

{"abstract": "In text classification the amount and quality of training data is crucial for the performance of the classifier. The generation of training data is done by human labelers - a tedious and time-consuming work. We propose to use condensed representations of text documents instead of the full-text document to reduce the labeling time for single documents. These condensed representations are key sentences and key phrases and can be generated in a fully unsupervised way. The key phrases are presented in a layout similar to a tag cloud. In a user study with 37 participants we evaluated whether document labeling with these condensed representations can be done faster and equally accurate by the human labelers. Our evaluation shows that the users labeled word clouds twice as fast but as accurately as full-text documents. While further investigations for different classification tasks are necessary, this insight could potentially reduce costs for the labeling process of text documents.", "authors": ["Christin Seifert", "Eva Ulbrich", "Michael Granitzer"], "n_citation": 8, "references": ["379938bf-60e9-4873-b6ea-cd2b2eabcd11", "4123bb52-0909-4dbd-a750-441db6e97953", "4adb467d-dacf-4019-b0d5-28ce1f323cf4", "4cbd7765-c47a-4004-a5f8-c2da7c7d1c7b", "633dbe31-9df1-4058-a1e3-01aa043c0c1e", "6a361b17-96a8-43db-a101-e1d0dd889fbf", "702a38fc-fa83-434f-89a6-cb50b574b695", "8026f56a-a93e-4933-8ead-c9aa9e3f0498", "8571378e-6886-4c62-9e80-8cf60a237083", "9a7da388-3ee0-473b-bf14-6eecceeb66ef", "efbfab76-9d48-4581-8061-9a2a4f82a266"], "title": "Word clouds for efficient document labeling", "venue": "discovery science", "year": 2011, "id": "18eeebc2-1ca5-4750-95cd-8494309561f8"}

{"abstract": "During a rehabilitation session, patient activity should be continuously monitored in order to correct wrong movements and to follow patient improvements. Therefore, the application of human motion tracking techniques to rehabilitation is finding more and more consensus. The aim of this paper is to propose a novel, low-cost method for hand pose estimation by using a monocular motion sensing device and a robust marker-based pose estimation approach based on the Unscented Kalman Filter. The hand kinematics is used to enclose geometrical constraints in the estimation process. The approach is applied for evaluating some significant kinematic parameters necessary for understanding human hand motor improvements during rehabilitation. In particular, the parameters evaluated for the hand fingers are joint positions, angles, Range Of Motion and trajectory. Moreover, the position, orientation and velocity of the wrist are estimated.", "authors": ["Francesca Cordella", "Francesco Di Corato", "Loredana Zollo", "Bruno Siciliano"], "n_citation": 2, "references": ["0e6b8506-f5c8-4a83-aad0-7a7a4d943ccb", "4c927ffe-7253-4922-ab42-6c144345c797", "61e09f39-642f-4dd3-98f2-8849339d5c75", "8bb53ded-ea13-40aa-a943-39ef4f4b38df", "a1fb7d7f-fb69-468e-8a17-d3c27a36616c", "ceb3f0ba-9e88-47f6-a173-40dba1f7271c", "e544930f-f489-4e82-8664-098b109d6727", "e6fc8f14-14a8-4272-893d-5f7bc6299b21", "f40d6047-67c3-44c8-9e97-12665db64157"], "title": "A Robust Hand Pose Estimation Algorithm for Hand Rehabilitation", "venue": "international conference on image analysis and processing", "year": 2013, "id": "19406a3e-477f-40a2-9bfe-0324f3b37900"}

{"abstract": "In the context of the User Interface design process, diverse user requirements are likely to dictate differentiated design decisions. When developing user-adapted interfaces, which are capable of personalizing to end-user attributes, it is required to identify all the necessary alternative design artifacts emerging from diverse user requirements, and organize them in a form more usable for the implementation process. Currently, design methodologies do not provide adequate support for structuring alternative design decisions for user-adapted interaction in a unified form, thus not supporting a concise architectural model for mapping the design outcomes to an implemented user-adapted interface. We have developed the unified design method for driving the design process of user-adapted interfaces. The unified design method, which produces a fusion of all alternative designs (in a single form), is based on task definition and incremental physical polymorphic specialization (the polymorphism criterion being the user attribute values).

{"abstract": "BPMN 2.0 is an OMG standard and one of the leading process modelling notations. Although the current language specification recognises the importance of defining a visual notation carefully, it does so by relying on common sense, intuition and emulation of common practices, rather than by adopting a rigorous scientific approach. This results in a number of suboptimal language design decisions that may impede effective model-mediated communication between stakeholders. We demonstrate and illustrate this by looking at BPMN 2.0 through the lens of the Physics of Notations, a collection of evidence-based principles that together form a theory of notation design.

{"abstract": "The Multilevel Load Balancing algorithm (MLB) is a parallel algorithm that determines the communication schedule that is necessary to balance a distributed discrete load function. The MLB algorithm focuses on structured grid computations and their load balancing requirements, which we feel are largely unsupported within the load balancing community. The interface to MLB is inherently simple; a distributed discrete load function is provided by the user and a communication schedule is returned. The load function can, for example, map to one or more distributed arrays. So far the implementation includes a parallel version of only the one dimensional MLB algorithm and produces a communication schedule that requires at most log(p) communication steps, where p is the number of processors (log() stands for the logarithm of base two).

{"abstract": "An exact parameterization for the boundary of the Minkowski product of N circular disks in the complex plane is derived. When N> 2, this boundary curve may be regarded as a generalization of the Cartesian oval that bounds the Minkowski product of two disks. The derivation is based on choosing a system of coordinated polar representations for the N operands, identifying sets of corresponding points with matched logarithmic Gauss map that may contribute to the Minkowski product boundary. By means of inversion in the operand circles, a geometrical characterization for their corresponding points is derived, in terms of intersections with the circles of a special coaxal system. The resulting parameterization is expressed as a product of N terms, each involving the radius of one disk, a single square root, and the sine and cosine of a common angular variable \u03d5 over a prescribed domain. As a special case, the N-th Minkowski power of a single disk is bounded by a higher trochoid. In certain applications, the availability of exact Minkowski products is a useful alternative to the naive bounding approximations that are customarily employed in \"complex circular arithmetic.\" 1.

{"abstract": "Black hole search (Bhs) is the problem of mapping or exploring a network where there are dangerous sites (black holes) that eliminate any incoming searcher without leaving a discernible trace. Dangerous graph exploration (Dge) extends the Bhs problem to include dangerous links (black links). In the literature, both problems have only been studied under the assumption that no faults occur in the network during the exploration. In this paper, we examine the impact that link failures can have on the exploration of dangerous graphs. We study the Dge problem under the following conditions: there are multiple black holes and black links, the network topology is unknown, the searchers are initially scattered in arbitrary locations, and the system is totally asynchronous. In this difficult setting, we assume that links can fail during the computation. We present an algorithm that solves the Dge in the presence of such dynamic link failures.

{"abstract": "The increased use of multimedia applications pose more problems concerning the preservation of confidentiality and authenticity of the transmission of digital data. These data, in particular the images should be protected from tampering. The solution is the use of fragile watermarking. Fragile watermarking can be modeled as a problem of communication of a signal over a noisy and hostile channel, where the attack takes place. Indeed, the use of error checking algorithms appear natural. . Cyclic redundancy check (CRC) code provides a simple, yet powerful, method for the detection of burst errors during digital data transmission and storage. CRC is one of the most versatile error checking algorithm used in various digital communication systems. In this paper, we propose a novel fragile watermarking scheme based CRC checksum and public key cryptosystem for RGB color image authentication.", "authors": ["Nour El-Houda Golea"], "n_citation": 0, "references": ["0fef7e80-d35f-4fae-b49c-bd291bc70942", "1f72f36a-565c-4e75-bd03-625fe7937290", "3d4acf45-5f76-48a0-a4ad-06bc54c7ecd7", "3fb43b00-905c-4a08-934d-198ea4eb66c3", "582d62ec-1c76-462e-9be5-1344ccb474ad", "909e9b98-9692-4087-b0e7-dd31d737a1a2", "e3d2fb5f-81b2-4fac-b0b1-5f6be75d3bc7", "ecf556ae-c7ab-4c82-81c8-853f59f35369", "f45e1d96-686a-4b59-8f2d-d6f4622b693d"], "title": "A Fragile Watermarking Scheme Based CRC Checksum and Public Key Cryptosystem for RGB Color Image Authentication", "venue": "international conference on image and signal processing", "year": 2012, "id": "1c397f39-a7fc-4531-8193-df5e6b46ca13"}

{"abstract": "We propose an axiomatization of global utility functions that can be factorized as a composition of a Choquet integral with local utility functions, without assuming any commensurability condition. This was an open problem in the literature. The main axiom, called Commensu- rability Through Interaction (CTI), allows to construct commensurate sequences and by consequence, the utility functions, thanks to the pres- ence of interaction between criteria. There exist several axiomatizations of the Choquet integral in the literature. The Choquet integral has been characterized as an aggregation function which has certain properties such as comonotone additivity (1), horizontally min-additivity (2,3) or stability to positive linear transformations (4). In the context of Decision Under Uncertainty (all partial utility functions are similar), we can mention the axiomatization of the preference relation induced by a Choquet integral by Schmeidler (5), and of the Choquet integral and its utility function by Couceiro and Marichal (6). The axiomatic characterization of the Choquet integral in the context of Multi-Criteria Decision Making has not been addressed so far. The difficulty comes from the fact that the partial utility functions are different, which entails commensurability issues. The main idea of this paper is summarized as follows. Commensurability between the criteria is required for the Choquet integral since this aggregation function is based on a ranking of the values of the criteria. Yet, the Choquet integral is a piecewise weighted sum in which the weights of the criteria are the same whenever the criteria are ranked in the same order. Considering two criteria i and k, the weight of criterion i depends on the relative values of criteria i and k. This means that, if the value of criterion k varies while the other criteria are fixed, then one may observe that the weight of criterion i suddenly changes when the value of criterion k is equal to that of criterion i .F rom this remark, it is possible to construct from an element of attribute i, an element of attribute k that is commensurate to the previous element. This construction does not work if the weight of criterion i does not depend on criterion k.

{"abstract": "A powerful method in knowledge discovery and cluster extraction is the use of self-organizing maps (SOMs), which provide adaptive quantization of the data together with its topologically ordered lower-dimensional representation on a rigid lattice. The knowledge extraction from SOMs is often performed interactively from informative visualizations. Even though interactive cluster extraction is successful, it is often time consuming and usually not straightforward for inexperienced users. In order to cope with the need of fast and accurate analysis of increasing amount of data, automated methods for SOM clustering have been popular. In this study, we use spectral clustering, a graph partitioning method based on eigenvector decomposition, for automated clustering of the SOM. Experimental results based on seven real data sets indicate that spectral clustering can successfully be used as an automated SOM segmentation tool, and it outperforms hierarchical clustering methods with distance based similarity measures.", "authors": ["Kadim Tasdemir"], "n_citation": 5, "references": ["0aa3ea99-91cc-4a8d-9de8-ff2bb5e8d58e", "32c5cd23-bcfc-4c4b-89a3-b29e93b6042c", "38135245-8eff-4078-af6a-ea559ffa660b", "4af43d64-b39c-4ca3-af98-c5f717104721", "68453f24-4276-4d0c-b37e-19d23af549be", "7c90045b-63b9-4f29-82a0-bf7c914a6ef6", "8d964e94-2cf8-47fb-89f5-e7667299c384", "9c19e13e-96b1-49f5-a552-e1d53bf4d2ef", "a8368e56-2e18-4168-9eb5-f0ead08c59ea", "bcef37e6-ffc9-47ef-b2b6-5b53dd0b5328", "bd55a32a-8dab-4551-806c-bce9e4a32c67", "df81d673-335a-480a-bec5-4e6a3a22416b", "e8ef24d9-a5ef-4e32-85f2-750d0658e1e8", "e9f3f2b2-e38e-4cb7-aa36-4994ef334a6e", "ea8cd3d8-17ae-4a1e-8f83-1609469087af", "eacc33ff-a680-4d3e-bb5f-ba6cf54041ac", "f2aadfc2-cda0-4dea-b786-29b578bfae0f"], "title": "Spectral clustering as an automated SOM segmentation tool", "venue": "", "year": 2011, "id": "1d2c0db5-13f8-4701-9f38-e15d9b6facdf"}

{"abstract": "This paper investigates the main causes that make the application migration to Cloud complicated and error-prone through two case studies. We first discuss the typical configuration errors in each migration case study based on our error categorization model, which classifies the configuration errors into seven categories. Then we describe the common installation errors across both case studies. By analyzing operator errors in our case studies for migrating applications to cloud, we present the design of CloudMig, a semi-automated migration validation system with two unique characteristics. First, we develop a continual query (CQ) based configuration policy checking system, which facilitate operators to weave important configuration constraints into CQ-based policies and periodically run these policies to monitor the configuration changes and detect and alert the possible configuration constraints violations. Second, CloudMig combines the CQ based policy checking with the template based installation automation to help operators reduce the installation errors and increase the correctness assurance of application migration. Our experiments show that CloudMig can effectively detect a majority of the configuration errors in the migration process.", "authors": ["Gong Zhang", "Ling Liu"], "n_citation": 50, "references": ["0625e224-dfa3-4135-9393-af066b8e605a", "0e051611-1d69-4df3-9429-54bde1925551", "a0653609-07ca-4482-9f20-22a5bedb6521", "ec69f31d-9bc5-4cab-8949-0c9421aa326a"], "title": "Why do migrations fail and what can we do about it", "venue": "usenix large installation systems administration conference", "year": 2011, "id": "1f20a48a-e4c5-4352-a05c-b8713bd0e0bc"}

The complexity and quantity of information to be faced with by these actors is increasing at an alarming rate. Research and development projects must turn to the development of innovative, modern technologies which enable citizens and businesses to access, understand and apply complex information easily. Ontology-based content management systems can contribute to the improvement of quality and effectiveness of significant processes, requiring the application of complex information, within the public administration or in a corporation. Compared to traditional content management systems, these systems can support further functions, such as semantic enabled search, explication of relations between documents, drafting of new documents, and version management, as well.

The EV technology will lead to funda- mental shift in existing power grid as well as transportation systems. In Smart grid, EVs play vital roles to reduce dependence on fossil fuel, in turn, minimize green house gas emissions. In Vehicle-to-Grid (V2G) network, EVs communicate with power grid operators to trade demand response services by delivering stored electricity into the electric power grid. Communication between aggregator and EVs is central for such an approach. Viewing security and privacy requirements for V2G communications, privacy-preserving technique is central for efficacious V2G network implementation. In this paper, we have proposed effective security and privacy-preserving mechanism for aggregator based V2G network, which is built on ECC-based restrictive partially blind signature.

{"abstract": "We investigate the problem of mining closed sets in multi-relational databases. Previous work introduced different semantics and associated algorithms for mining closed sets in multirelational databases. However, insight into the implications of semantic choices and the relationships among them was still lacking. Our investigation shows that the semantic choices are important because they imply different properties, which in turn affect the range of algorithms that can mine for such sets. Of particular interest is the question whether the seminal LCM algorithm by Uno et al. can be upgraded towards multi-relational problems.

A major limitation of the MTANN is a long training time. To address this issue, we investigated the feasibility of a support vector regression (SVR) in the massive-training framework and developed a massive-training SVR (MTSVR). To test the proposed MTSVR, we compared it with the original MTANN in FP reduction in CADe of polyps in CTC. With MTSVR, we reduced the training time by a factor of 190, while achieving a performance (by-polyp sensitivity of 94.7% with 2.5 FPs/patient) comparable to that of the original MTANN (which has the same sensitivity with 2.6 FPs/patient).", "authors": ["Jian-Wu Xu", "Kenji Suzuki"], "n_citation": 3, "references": ["01b486c4-8955-403b-a0c6-1de74298b215", "9206deed-8d57-428b-a6a5-0105af37c74a"], "title": "False-positive reduction in computer-aided detection of polyps in CT colonography: a massive-training support vector regression approach", "venue": "", "year": 2010, "id": "20842fd1-58b7-443f-acf0-d15676b2b6bf"}

Computer-interpretable guidelines (CIGs) can deliver patient-specific advice during clinical encounters, which makes them more likely to affect clinician behavior than narrative guidelines. To reduce the number of errors that are introduced while developing narrative guidelines and CIGs, we studied the process used by the ACP-ASIM to develop clinical algorithms from narrative guidelines. We analyzed how changes progressed between subsequent versions of an algorithm and between a narrative guideline and its derived clinical algorithm. We recommend procedures that could limit the number of errors produced when generating clinical algorithms. In addition, we developed a tool for authoring CIGs in GLIF3 format and validating their syntax, data type matches, cardinality constraints, and structural integrity constraints.

{"abstract": "In the vision of an IoT, trillions of tiny devices extend the Internet to the physical world and enable novel applications that have not been possible before. Such applications emerge out of the interaction of these devices with each other and with more powerful server-class computers on the Internet. Programming such applications is challenging due to the massively distributed nature of these networks combined with the challenges of embedded programming. In addition, resource constraints, device heterogeneity, and the integration with the Internet further complicate this situation. In this paper, we present a programming-in-the-large approach for resource-constraint devices such as wireless sensor nodes. Our approach is to model such applications using the Business Process Execution Language (BPEL), which is successfully and widely used in the Internet to model complete applications and business processes. However, BPEL and its associated technologies are too resourcedemanding to be directly applied in resource-constraint environments. We therefore use the BPEL model as input to a code generation process that generates custom-tailored, lean code for different target platforms. The resulting code is fully standard-compliant and allows a seamless integration of IoT devices in enterprise IT environments. We present an exhaustive evaluation on real hardware showing the first-rate performance of the approach.", "authors": ["Nils Glombitza", "Sebastian Ebers", "Dennis Pfisterer", "Stefan Fischer"], "n_citation": 50, "references": ["02f9e979-9aab-4554-91ef-d35757ce8fdc", "0c5b9fa3-6eec-4c52-af14-85e5d5b0e58f", "1aa7b81b-5e9e-428b-8c3f-3f548c5280e2", "83228db6-3d7f-4acd-a225-ff851f94dd6a", "a6999103-8c23-4c45-b150-f10d32d52fa1", "fa94ca04-772c-43fd-a643-1226357e3110", "ff26e02e-a117-4ca7-9ef5-4fdeabeb6167", "ffa2993d-e1af-458e-ae43-5be01f03ebfe"], "title": "Using BPEL to realize business processes for an internet of things", "venue": "ad hoc mobile and wireless networks", "year": 2011, "id": "216bcdf6-f86f-4c12-b510-d492108d27a6"}

{"abstract": "Voting is a simple mechanism to aggregate the preferences of agents. Many voting rules have been shown to be NP-hard to manipulate. However, a number of recent theoretical results suggest that this complexity may only be in the worst-case since manipulation is often easy in practice. In this paper, we show that empirical studies are useful in improving our understanding of this issue. We demonstrate that there is a smooth transition in the probability that a coalition can elect a desired candidate using the veto rule as the size of the manipulating coalition increases. We show that a rescaled probability curve displays a simple and universal form independent of the size of the problem. We argue that manipulation of the veto rule is asymptotically easy for many independent and identically distributed votes even when the coalition of manipulators is critical in size. Based on this argument, we identify a situation in which manipulation is computationally hard. This is when votes are highly correlated and the election is \"hung\". We show, however, that even a single uncorrelated voter is enough to make manipulation easy again.", "authors": ["Toby Walsh"], "n_citation": 87, "references": ["0181b1dc-346e-4c70-bff0-2768954ecd5f", "06678ba3-931f-4a35-b9eb-6b6f7e5e9a6f", "0ba81bf9-2175-4acc-a9e6-44d99b476204", "0f41c7e6-6eaf-443a-8fca-adacc859c133", "113dac8f-c770-41a3-9929-7114df306150", "20ac1eea-b13e-4355-ad61-b1371afbc5cd", "26af2d48-9d88-4461-bd80-73bd81ca7a4f", "288dce14-855c-4502-a7d2-cbc4dee2a31e", "45147d7b-255d-45e0-85c6-5646b1f039c7", "502e0498-5719-455a-8859-eced8d57e8cf", "70c0371b-3648-4513-a31f-764a09a800cb", "720f7c91-96b0-4e32-928c-9e60f6e57963", "77688f15-5878-4c40-80c3-1f567ab6ea20", "7d13466a-ddc8-49fd-a55d-eec7222dbb38", "84732c65-2a0f-4bdc-9001-bae7b5418b6a", "9a0aad07-b223-4ab1-8686-9bb9fcd91a41", "9dc3e527-4602-4fa1-86fa-697a92da0c91", "9f3c236c-fad9-4f36-ba6d-6b773bf86aa3", "acc5b8ef-c541-454a-bdc1-5ada474c26c6", "e73da790-9b08-4e42-b1cb-c35479704b5c"], "title": "Where are the really hard manipulation problems? the phase transition in manipulating the veto rule", "venue": "international joint conference on artificial intelligence", "year": 2009, "id": "21ab7cbc-12ec-4def-a407-48fbee0fcb06"}

If p has only real coefficients the coefficients of this expansion, the so-called Bernstein coefficients, provide lower and upper bounds for the range. In the case that p has complex coefficients the convex hull of the Bernstein coefficients encloses the range. The enclosure is improved by subdividing the unit triangle into squares and triangles and computing enclosures for the range of p over these regions.

{"abstract": "Decision making under uncertainty is one of the most important challenges within the research field of artificial intelligence, as they present many everyday situations that agents have to face. Within these situations, an agent has to choose from a set of options, whose payoff is uncertain (i.e. unknown and nondeterministic) to the agent. Common to such decision making problems is the need of balancing between exploration and exploitation, where the agent, in order to maximise its total payoff, must decide whether to choose the option expected to provide the best payoff (exploitation) or to try an alternative option for potential future benefit (exploration). Among many decision under uncertainty abstractions, multi\u2013armed bandits are perhaps one of the most common and best studied, as they present one of the clearest examples of the trade\u2013off between exploration and exploitation. Whilst the standard bandit model has a broad applicability, it does not completely describe a number of real\u2013world decision making problems. Specifically, in many cases, pulling choice of arm (i.e. making a decision)is further constrained by several costs or limitations. In this thesis, we introduce the budget\u2013limited bandit model, a variant of the standard bandits, in which pulling an arm is costly, and is limited by a fixed budget. This model is motivated by a number of real\u2013world applications, such as wireless sensor networks, or online advertisement.#R##N##R##N#We demonstrate that our bandit model cannot be reduced to other existing bandits, as it requires a different optimal behaviour. Given this, the main objective of this thesis#R##N#is to provide novel pulling algorithms that efficiently tackle the budget\u2013limited bandit problem. Such algorithms, however, have to meet a number of requirements from both#R##N#the empirical and the theoretical perspectives. The former refers to the constraints desired by the motivations of real\u2013world applications, whilst the latter aims to provide#R##N#theoretical performance guarantees. To begin with, we propose a simple pulling algorithm, the budget\u2013limited ?\u2013first, that addresses the empirical requirements. In more detail, the budget\u2013limited ?\u2013first algorithm is an empirically efficient algorithm with low computational cost, which, however, does not fulfil the theoretical requirements. To provide theoretical guarantees, we introduce two budget\u2013limited UCB based algorithms, namely: KUBE and fractional KUBE,iv that efficiently tackle the theoretical requirements. In particular, we prove that these algorithms achieve asymptotically optimal performance regret bounds, which only differ from the best optimal bound by a constant factor. However, we demonstrate in extensive simulations that these algorithms are typically outperformed by the budget\u2013limited ?\u2013first. As a result, to efficiently trade off between theoretical and empirical requirements, we develop two decreasing ?\u2013greedy based approaches, namely: KDE and fractional KDE, that achieve good performance from both the theoretical and the empirical perspective. Specifically, we show that, similar to the budget\u2013limited UCB based algorithms, both KDE and fractional KDE achieve asymptotically optimal performance regret bounds. In addition, we also demonstrate that these algorithms perform well, compared to the budget\u2013limited ? first.#R##N##R##N#To provide a grounding for the algorithms we develop, the second part of this thesis contains a running example of a wireless sensor network (WSN) scenario, in which we tackle#R##N#the problem of long\u2013term information collection, a key research challenge within the domain of WSNs. In more detail, we demonstrate that by using the budget\u2013limited bandit algorithms, we advance the state\u2013of\u2013the\u2013art within this domain. In so doing, we first decompose#R##N#the problem of long\u2013term information collection into two sub\u2013problems, namely the energy management and the maximal information throughput routing problems. We then tackle the former with a budget\u2013limited multi\u2013armed bandit based approach, and we propose an optimal decentralised algorithm for the latter. Following this, we demonstrate that the budget\u2013limited bandit based energy management, in conjunction with the optimal routing algorithm, outperforms the state\u2013of\u2013the\u2013art information collecting algorithms in the domain of WSNs.", "authors": ["Long Tran-Thanh"], "n_citation": 10, "title": "Budget-limited multi-armed bandits", "venue": "", "year": 2012, "id": "23abc3f8-2fc3-4dd9-a752-31928d7fb2ba"}

{"abstract": "Learning research has argued the importance of providing authentic contexts for learning. However, traditional learning environments are often disconnected from external communities of practice. For example, students might design and carry out scientific experiments that are valuable pedagogically, but do not contribute to science itself. In this study, we used the Game Ontology Project (GOP), a wiki-enabled hierarchy of elements of gameplay used by games studies researchers, in a game design class. Students found it useful for learning. However, encouraging sustained participation was challenging because students tended to view the GOP as a static source, rather than a participatory and editable resource. Expert analysis of the student's contributions to the ontology found them to be useful and significant. We conclude with thoughts on the importance of these kinds of authentic environments in traditional learning.", "authors": ["Jos\u00e9 Pablo Zagal", "Amy Bruckman"], "n_citation": 50, "references": ["1d13398f-8dee-4e3f-af73-024f2dae4b8b", "33d63c7f-3df6-4310-9ea3-93836ef151d8", "7c0f8ab1-ce59-4e71-a82d-cebf3eee8117", "a633330d-c81c-4d81-bad2-1b6577b82039", "affb4cff-9de1-479a-8adb-f6953e50e783"], "title": "The game ontology project: supporting learning while contributing authentically to game studies", "venue": "", "year": 2008, "id": "23e39d5e-940b-478a-a47e-e93fb9ebfe66"}

{"abstract": "In this paper, we present a novel approach in automatic discourse segmentation without a full semantic understanding. In order to analyse the textual bonds and determine the degree of coherence that a discourse may exhibit, we first represent the tremendous diversity of textual relations into a discourse network. A set of mutual linguistic constraints that largely determines the similarity of meaning among lexical items is encoded. Topic boundaries in a discourse are identified through a computational method which identifies the segment cluster from a higher order structure in the discourse network. Our segmentation is regarded as a process of identifying the shifts from one segment cluster to another. Experimental results show that our formulation is capable to address the topic shifts of texts. Comparison with a related method demonstrates that the combination of constraints is closely related, to the topic boundaries among textual segments. Evaluation using recall and precision shows the effectiveness of our approach in a collection of Chinese newswire articles.", "authors": ["Samuel W. K. Chan", "Benjamin K.

{"abstract": "Computer vision system is one of the newest approaches for human computer interaction. Recently, the direct use of our hands as natural input devices has shown promising progress. Toward this progress, we introduce a hand gesture recognition system in this study to recognize real time gesture in unconstrained environments. The system consists of three components: real time hand tracking, hand-tree construction, and hand gesture recognition. Our main contribution includes: (1) a simple way to represent the hand gesture after applying thinning algorithm to the image, and (2) using a model of complex-valued neural network (CVNN) for real-valued classification. We have tested our system to 26 different gestures to evaluate the effectiveness of our approach. The results show that the classification ability of single-layered CVNN on unseen data is comparable to the conventional real-valued neural network (RVNN) having one hidden layer.

The mech- anism enforces access policy to data containing personally identifiable information. The key component of the framework is purpose involved access control models (PAC ) that provide full support for expressing highly complex privacy-related policies, taking into account features like purposes and conditions. A policy refers to an access right that a subject can have on an object, based on attribute predicates, obligation actions, and system conditions. Policy conflicting problems may arise when new access policies are generated.

We investigate whether poor outcomes of an ICU can be traced back to excess deaths in specific patient subgroups, by discovering candidate subgroups, with a modified adaptive decision tree boosting algorithm applied to 80 Dutch ICUs. Genuine subgroups were selected from candidate subgroups when the case-mix adjusted outcomes were poorer than those of the five top performing ICUs. For 59 ICUs we discovered 122 genuine subgroups and most were defined by one to four variables, with a median of three [2\u20134]. Variables Glasgow Coma Scale and age were used most. There were 29 ICUs with overall poor outcomes, and for 22 our algorithm found all excess deaths. A new method based on adaptive decision tree boosting discovered many subgroups of ICU patients for which there is potentially room for outcomes improvement.", "authors": ["Antonie Koetsier", "Nicolette de Keizer", "Ameen Abu-Hanna", "Niels Peek"], "n_citation": 0, "title": "A modified real AdaBoost algorithm to discover intensive care unit subgroups with a poor outcome.", "venue": "", "year": 2013, "id": "26017a16-e4d2-455c-aba6-e95358317f45"}
{"abstract": "Recommender Systems RS have risen in popularity over the years, and their ability to ease decision-making for the user in various domains has made them ubiquitous. However, the sparsity of data continues to be one of the biggest shortcomings of the suggestions offered. Recommendation algorithms typically model user preferences in the form of a profile, which is then used to match user preferences to items of their interest. Consequently, the quality of recommendations is directly related to the level of detail contained in these profiles. Several attempts at enriching the user profiles leveraging both user preference data and item content details have been explored in the past. We propose a method of constructing a user profile, specifically for the movie domain, based on user preference for keyword clusters, which indirectly captures preferences for various narrative styles. These profiles are then utilized to perform both content-based CB filtering as well as collaborative filtering CF. The proposed approach scores over the direct keyword-matching, genre-based user profiling and the traditional CF methods under sparse data scenarios as established by various experiments. It has the advantage of a compact user model representation, while at the same time capturing the essence of the styles or genres preferred by the user. The identification of implicit genres is captured effectively through clustering without requiring labeled data for training.", "authors": ["Deepa Anand", "Bonson Sebastian Mampilli"], "n_citation": 50, "references": ["0ea745c7-58b2-48e8-9115-42e9b0d20f2a", "0f4787f1-ccf1-4aab-ad94-4161b32ecee0", "58342d36-e657-4ef3-a3ec-7a5bce1fdb7e", "6436f6ee-7ec7-4cee-b590-ffc39cc2578a", "669c4126-0a9c-4692-be13-b65c1c9f032d", "92e490f5-6b38-4cab-a848-90368f04540f", "93cf69a3-9ef3-431e-8731-9d99d1535d7a"], "title": "User Profiling Based on Keyword Clusters for Improved Recommendations", "venue": "international conference on distributed computing and internet technology", "year": 2014, "id": "2614625d-a98b-4de7-a115-96c702014e63"}

{"abstract": "This paper presents and evaluates ORiNoCo, a novel data-collection and event-reporting protocol for sensor networks. ORiNoCo is built upon the asynchronous duty-cycle protocol RI-MAC and breaks with the tradition of exchanging extensive neighborhood information, a cornerstone of many competing collection protocols and one of their major source of communication overhead and energy expenditure. The merit of this venture is an opportunistic, energy-efficient, latency-reducing, and self-stabilizing protocol. ORiNoCo comes at virtually no extra costs in terms of memory demand and communication overhead compared to RI-MAC. We derive theoretical boundaries for the improvements in radio efficiency, latency, and energy-consumption. ORiNoCo is verified with these findings via simulation and compared with CTP. ORiNoCo achieves lower energy-consumption while reducing end-to-end delays.", "authors": ["Stefan Untersch\u00fctz", "Christian Renner", "Volker Turau"], "n_citation": 50, "references": ["15f7fee5-ccaa-44bd-a61b-386bf430db59", "16a43bb9-ad3d-4310-9034-f06427d81af3", "197f73b4-fe75-46c5-a812-c30ed3656185", "314c5a50-5eb8-4377-9861-e4367ff86462", "314d7304-a00e-4f73-bfc7-8a87dec8cf5c", "5833c841-09ca-40f0-8433-26cbe714ad47", "8be4f96f-035c-4f05-a329-0bfadcaffe27", "96b245c2-47a5-4aec-89f0-d2a362124845", "afb68332-5c98-4ec4-a9c7-b1e218a0d894", "b1cc0550-bea3-448b-83da-870c743db074", "b5b8132d-0a8c-4e6c-999f-839f0cef48b7", "bdb195c7-7e08-4d51-8961-3a71b132dff8", "c1f5f444-6e58-4de8-bfbe-39f14bb67a28", "c41e853f-d1f4-4755-9981-cddb023d68f1", "cc62f28c-544c-4845-a1f8-95ba363bbc66", "d8164b0c-6d5d-48a7-b1e2-7a54c5f2636c", "e2ed1093-7749-419b-8a6e-e4088a15fcfa"], "title": "Opportunistic, receiver-initiated data-collection protocol", "venue": "international conference on embedded wireless systems and networks", "year": 2012, "id": "2643b9fd-f5c8-4999-8edf-690e50f6fd3d"}

{"abstract": "The application of formal methods especially, model checking and static analysis techniques for the verification of safety critical embedded systems has produced very good results and raised the interest of system designers up to the application of these technologies in real size projects. However, these methods usually rely on specific verification oriented formal languages that most designers do not master. It is thus mandatory to embed the associated tools in automated verification toolchains that allow designers to rely on their usual domain-specific modeling languages DSMLs while enjoying the benefits of these powerful methods. More precisely, we propose a language to formally express system requirements and interpret verification results so that system designers DSML end-users avoid the burden of learning some formal verification technologies. Formal verification is achieved through translational semantics. This work is based on a metamodeling pattern for executable DSML that favors the definition of generative tools and thus eases the integration of tools for new DSMLs.", "authors": ["Faiez Zalila", "Xavier Cr\u00e9gut", "Marc Pantel"], "n_citation": 11, "references": ["36b12f15-f892-4a7a-b5cc-f76172910803", "39cbd5b7-d48a-409e-b642-83f7f5984836", "44f1976e-9b26-48b8-8704-f1eddda98e9f", "46c8d6cb-94fe-4b83-8086-f0dc713177ba", "6788580c-4a96-48d6-a810-593a449b9293", "9849d9c4-a97f-452f-882c-42a8c6cab0b5", "9ed087ab-6c81-4122-8561-d7eb2265e347", "b0f10460-1c4e-4e9c-8d30-397644798fa3", "b9c5f4c2-2870-42c9-9d4e-45a0a726b0d6", "baf3cc15-87d0-4f0d-94f1-31df22cea410", "c6b144a8-2239-406c-878a-3f8a6c73f830", "f82b989d-722f-44bc-80be-08983f06aca6", "fe404c3c-2eee-4fd5-b105-9c60ec5dd1d3"], "title": "Formal Verification Integration Approach for DSML", "venue": "model driven engineering languages and systems", "year": 2013, "id": "271d75bc-c48a-4d2c-8a05-05c17089505f"}

{"abstract": "Software protection is one of the most important issues concerning computer practice. The problem is to sell programs that can be executed by the buyer, yet cannot be duplicated and/or distributed by him to other users. There exist many heuristics and ad-hoc methods for protection, but the problem as a whole did not receive the theoretical treatment it deserves.In this paper, we make the first steps towards a theoretic treatment of software protection: First, we distill and formulate the key problem of learning about a program from its execution. Second, we present an efficient way of executing programs (i.e. a interpreter) such that it is infeasible to learn anything about the program by monitoring its executions. A scheme that protects against duplication follows.How can one efficiently execute programs without allowing an adversary, monitoring the execution, to learn anything about the program ? Current cryptographic techniques can be applied to keep the contents of the memory unknow throughout the execution, but are not applicable to the problem of hiding the access pattern. Hiding the access pattern efficiently is the essence of our solution.

{"abstract": "The literature suggests that business-IT alignment is an important antecedent of IS success, business process performance, and competitive advantage. Additionally, IT governance practices are highlighted as being instrumental to fostering business-IT alignment. In this paper, we derive various IT governance practices (in terms of structures, processes, relational mechanisms, and enterprise architecture characteristics) from literature and expert interviews. While prior investigations only considered the effect of such practices on strategic business-IT alignment, we also incorporate alignment at operational level. Using results from a case study in the IT services division of a large multi-national, multi-divisional company acting in diverse industries we highlight the effect of various IT governance practices and offer new insights by showing which mechanisms are effective in facilitating strategic or operational business-IT alignment. Our results indicate the most important practices for both strategic and operational alignment.", "authors": ["Frank Schlosser", "Heinz-Theo Wagner"], "n_citation": 6, "references": ["0f95bfbb-6fe0-487f-ae7e-cef09262d3b4", "10b24f7a-01d2-446e-b35e-1ddc0c592c17", "2819d0c5-ecb8-47bf-a039-6ae12e308990", "33a355b2-0bfd-4ad2-ad35-fdad404320b6", "4c362a72-93f6-466a-932a-894a2a7e21cc", "5e6ba10f-32c8-45c5-8e2d-52f5fc53c5f5", "6158ca0b-ee8e-43c2-b896-b0b93f08c39f", "64a8dbbf-7e6c-4fb8-8905-c0e3f482345f", "6a281c66-0156-48fe-93b4-0ecf7eb59ed5", "73d60330-2c02-43d2-8552-0438748a0364", "75aa36b5-c66d-4269-adf6-efae9ad1da44", "7bb8cdec-c00f-46a9-ae1e-80af777ff347", "7f39e3c4-82f1-4a9a-b4ab-29130826e373", "8d2d7baf-b156-4e61-b13f-8a07d4180a65", "90c732ce-9365-486e-bd5a-be52236504f7", "9a8d1944-bbbc-42cf-baca-b2f6a176f90f", "9da39d15-65c3-4eee-a208-fac0547a2db8", "a323c213-137f-429e-8476-b61ab2feb598", "b1ee7315-9410-43c1-b4de-d2269ede2d63", "ba361ed3-8325-4c97-ab0c-ddeb101dc6e2", "bb5cdc94-da2e-4fd9-b0a8-6465f3ede1ca", "c37fff00-dc07-4cbe-a4b2-3925b506a507", "c933ccc2-92df-4fb9-8412-4f1d10fa676f", "e1762b5c-6758-4cc9-a62c-2f58fd8f054d", "e34fa5fe-b8ef-4198-a709-138ca6340ba6", "feb84715-8166-4c1a-a051-435119d5b31c"], "title": "IT GOVERNANCE PRACTICES FOR IMPROVING STRATEGIC AND OPERATIONAL BUSINESS-IT ALIGNMENT", "venue": "pacific asia conference on information systems", "year": 2011, "id": "27e35413-71c6-46e0-840b-9f4279203215"}

{"abstract": "Modern process control systems are increasingly vulnerable to subver- sion. Attacks that directly target production processes are difficult to detect because signature-based approaches are not well-suited to the unique requirements of process control systems. Also, anomaly detec- tion mechanisms have difficulty coping with the non-linearity of indus- trial processes. This paper focuses on the problem where attackers gain supervisory control of systems and hide their manipulations in signal noise or con- ceal computational states. To detect these attacks, we identify suitable proxy measurements for the output of a control system. Utilizing control laws, we compare the estimated system output using real-time numerical simulation along with the actual output to detect attacker manipula- tions. This approach also helps determine the intervention required to return the process to a safe state. The approach is demonstrated using a heat exchange process as a case study. By employing an explicit control model rather than a learning system or anomaly detection approach, the minimal requirements on proxy sensors and the need for additional sensors can be characterized. This significantly improves resilience while minimizing cost.", "authors": ["Thomas Richard McEvoy", "Stephen D.

{"abstract": "Self-regulated learning (SRL) involves a complex set of interactions between cognitive, metacognitive, motivational and affective processes. The key to understanding the influence of these self-regulatory processes on learning with open-ended, non-linear learning computerbased environments involves detecting, capturing, identifying, and classifying these processes as they temporally unfold during learning. Understanding the complex nature of these processes is key to building intelligent learning environments that are capable of adapting to the inherent fluctuations in learners' SRL processes and emerging understanding of the embedded educational content and related disciplinary knowledge. Recent developments in the use of and advances in the design of artificial pedagogical agents have begun to address these issues. However, we are still experiencing major theoretical, conceptual, methodological, and analytical challenges that may impede our ability to design more intelligent agents that are effectively and reliably able to detect, model, and foster learners SRL processes during learning. As such, the foci of this presentation are to: (1) introduce the complexity of SRL with current intelligent agent systems, (2) briefly present a hybrid theoretical model of SRL and describe how it can be used to analyze the temporally, unfolding sequences of processes during learning, (3) present and describe sample data to illustrate the nature and complexity of these processes and the various challenges they pose for designers and learners, and (4) present challenges for future research that combines several techniques and methods to design pedagogical agents and intelligent learning environments that effectively and reliably trace, model, and foster SRL.", "authors": ["Roger Azevedo"], "n_citation": 50, "title": "Can we design artificial pedagogical agents to be intelligent enough to detect, model, and foster regulatory learning processes?", "venue": "", "year": 2011, "id": "2897d44a-b32b-4797-ad68-d689b603d369"}

{"abstract": "This paper describes the evaluation of the system for selective dissemination of Broadcast News that we developed in the context of the European project ALERT. Each component of the main processing block of our system was evaluated separately, using the ALERT corpus. Likewise, the user interface was also evaluated separately. Besides this modular evaluation which will be briefly mentioned here, as a reference, the system can also be evaluated as a whole, in a field trial from the point of view of a potential user. This is the main topic of this paper. The analysis of the main sources of problems hinted at a large number of issues that must be dealt with in order to improve the performance.

{"abstract": "The power of mobile devices has increased dramatically in the last few years. These devices are becoming more sophisticated allowing users to accomplish a wide variety of tasks while on the move. The increasingly mobile nature of business has meant that more users will need access to spreadsheets while away from their desktop and laptop computers. Existing mobile applications suffer from a number of usability issues that make using spreadsheets in this way more difficult. This work represents the first evaluation of mobile spreadsheet applications. Through a pilot survey the needs and experiences of experienced spreadsheet users was examined. The range of spreadsheet apps available for the iOS platform was also evaluated in light of these users' needs.", "authors": ["Derek Flood", "Rachel Harrison", "Kevin McDaid"], "n_citation": 50, "references": ["2102c5a7-8e0c-4ba2-afa4-e37ba60705d5", "31907400-7900-4f88-9f8c-2aa8a9e2bc5f", "3ae230fe-d17e-4992-a3ce-b3cd26382990", "7e371fcc-59b1-4ac4-a4fd-d3bcb8628412", "8ac25166-d692-4b2f-9461-ab5e1f16bb43", "c0efc8b0-a488-463e-94b8-ee55df1e08bd"], "title": "Spreadsheets on the Move: An Evaluation of Mobile Spreadsheets", "venue": "arXiv: Human-Computer Interaction", "year": 2011, "id": "292a2549-24ab-460b-94b0-cdce398d6ef3"}

This is the first such algorithm that supports both insertions and deletions of points to the set  S : previous algorithms for approximating the width of a point set only supported additions [Agarwal et al. 2004; Chan 2006], or a sliding window [Chan and Sadjad 2006].

{"abstract": "The beeping channel model is a multiple access channel (MAC) model where active nodes can only send/hear a \"jamming\" signal (i.e. a beep) through the communication channel in each time slot [2]. A listening node hears a beep signal if at least one node is beeping; otherwise it hears nothing. The beeping model was recently proposed to model carrier-sensing-based wireless communication [2], and the Delta-Notch signalling mechanism between biological cells [1]. The motivation of our work, however, is to design efficient digital circuits. It turns out that the beeping channel model well characterizes the behaviors of a group of sequential logic modules connected by a logical-OR gate. A strictly synchronized global clock is available in such a circuit. In a clock cycle, a high electrical level in each input wire of the OR gate corresponds to the choice to beep made by the module connecting to this input wire while a low level corresponds to the choice not to beep. The output of the OR gate is wired back to each module as the source signal in the next cycle.

{"abstract": "This paper concerns labelled Markov processes (LMPs), probabilistic models over uncountable state spaces originally introduced by Prakash Panangaden and colleagues. Motivated by the practical ap- plication of the LMP framework, we study its formal semantics and the relationship to similar models formulated in control theory. We consider notions of (exact and approximate) probabilistic bisimulation over LMPs and, drawing on methods from both formal verification and control the- ory, propose a simple technique to compute an approximate probabilistic bisimulation of a given LMP, where the resulting abstraction is charac- terised as a finite-state labelled Markov chain (LMC). This construction enables the application of automated quantitative verification and pol- icy synthesis techniques over the obtained abstract model, which can be used to perform approximate analysis of the concrete LMP. We illustrate this process through a case study of a multi-room heating system that employs the probabilistic model checker PRISM.", "authors": ["Alessandro Abate", "Marta Z.

{"abstract": "Cross-domain text classification aims to automatically train a precise text classifier for a target domain by using labeled text data from a related source domain. To this end, the distribution gap between different domains has to be reduced. In previous works, a certain number of shared latent features (e.g., latent topics, principal components, etc.) are extracted to represent documents from different domains, and thus reduce the distribution gap. However, only relying the shared latent features as the domain bridge may limit the amount of knowledge transferred. This limitation is more serious when the distribution gap is so large that only a small number of latent features can be shared between domains. In this paper, we propose a novel approach named Topic Correlation Analysis (TCA), which extracts both the shared and the domain-specific latent features to facilitate effective knowledge transfer. In TCA, all word features are first grouped into the shared and the domain-specific topics using a joint mixture model. Then the correlations between the two kinds of topics are inferred and used to induce a mapping between the domain-specific topics from different domains. Finally, both the shared and the mapped domain-specific topics are utilized to span a new shared feature space where the supervised knowledge can be effectively transferred. The experimental results on two real-world data sets justify the superiority of the proposed method over the stat-of-the-art baselines.", "authors": ["Lianghao Li", "Xiaoming Jin", "Mingsheng Long"], "n_citation": 50, "references": ["28903e7b-aa3b-4840-b634-916029ed6c77", "312e54ca-e7e9-4129-99f4-36f3aeff827e", "34a35de8-db8b-4b1d-bdcf-96e10e0587fa", "3796757e-4c43-4459-b65b-927d8bc7f6f2", "449d0b2e-d401-4831-ba26-564e18178573", "4cbd7765-c47a-4004-a5f8-c2da7c7d1c7b", "5855e2d7-bd7f-416a-a1cc-fa1c625f49a2", "9f79df9c-625a-4df0-aafb-3e6eaf98e736", "ab68780d-3419-4b9f-be4a-354c01e6ca6c", "c0c6f8d0-ca71-4813-a271-065926bb2662", "d0a24b88-3a63-4cf1-bb51-8161643082af", "e9f5e156-5766-4494-ae9a-33ffbc4ef53b"], "title": "Topic correlation analysis for cross-domain text classification", "venue": "national conference on artificial intelligence", "year": 2012, "id": "2b78e1ff-184f-4314-9de5-82a92e8591fc"}

In this paper, we report on the results of a study in which we implemented a Delphi decision-making approach in SAP StreamWork, a web-based social media platform that supports social interaction and decision making. As with most social media systems, contributions by individuals in SAP StreamWork are shared immediately and attributed to the contributors. At first glance, these characteristics are at odds with the anonymity and iterative structure of the Delphi approach. We describe how we integrated the structured processes of the Delphi approach into the open collaboration model of SAP StreamWork and report on an evaluation of our system in which two groups used the resulting prototype tool for a real-life decision-making activity.", "authors": ["Fan Dong", "Adam Binnie", "Kelly A.

{"abstract": "Triplet Markov fields (TMFs) model recently proposed is to deal with nonstationary image segmentation and has achieved promising results. In this paper, we propose a multiscale and multidirection TMF model for nonstationary synthetic aperture radar (SAR) image multiclass segmentation in nonsubsampled contourlet transform (NSCT) domain, named as NSCT-TMF model. NSCT-TMF model is capable of capturing the contextual information of image content in the spatial and scale spaces effectively by the construction of multiscale energy functions. And the derived multiscale and multidirection likelihoods of NSCT-TMF model can capture the dependencies of NSCT coefficients across scale and directions.

The Shannon entropies required to construct the Jensen-Shannon divergence for pairs of hypergraphs are obtained from steady state probability distributions of the random walk. The Jensen-Shannon divergence between a pair of hypergraphs is the difference between the Shannon entropies of the separate hypergraphs and a composite structure.

In this paper, we present an overview of different brightness and gradient constraints used with the inverse compositional algorithm.

The constraint combines brightness and gradient constraints under multiple quadratic errors. The method can accommodate various motion models. We concentrate on the global efficiency of the constraint in capturing the global motion for image alignment. We have applied the algorithm to various test sequences with ground truth.

{"abstract": "An active set is a unifying space being able to act as a \"bridge\" for transferring information, ideas and results between distinct types of uncertainties and different types of applications. An active set is a set of agents who independently deliver true or false values for a given proposition. An active set is not a simple vector of logic values for different propositions, the results are a vector but the set is not. The difference between an ordinary set and active set is that the ordinary set has passive elements with values of the attributes defined by an external agent, in the active set any element is an agent that internally defines the value of a given attribute for a passive element. In this paper we show the connection between classical, fuzzy, evidence theory and active sets. In conclusion at one external agent we substitute a set of experts or agents that evaluate in a conflicting way the logic value of a given proposition or attribute. Under the same meta level of active sets we can discover analogy and similarity among distinct theories of uncertainty and types of many valued logics.", "authors": ["Germano Resconi", "Chris J.

On the receiver side estimation of missing vectors is applied to reconstruct the feature vector stream prior to recognition. Finally, the decoding process of the recogniser is modified to take into account the varying reliability of these estimated feature vectors.

{"abstract": "Nous avons tous l'intuition qu'un travail peut etre realise en beaucoup moins de temps s'il est reparti entre plusieurs personnes ou sur plusieurs machines. Cette notion se nomme le parallelisme qui peut se definir comme l'etat de ce qui se developpe dans la meme direction ou en meme temps. C'est naturellement que la notion de parallelisme a ete appliquee aux ordinateurs. De ce fait, il a ete possible de repondre aux besoins de puissance necessaire a la realisation de projets gourmands en temps de calculs et en taille memoire. Le parallelisme combine a une algorithmique performante permet de gagner du temps afin de repondre au mieux a d'importants besoins. Il rompt avec l'approche classique qui consiste a gagner de la vitesse en effectuant plus rapidement chaque operation, approche bornee par les lois de la physique. La notion de parallelisme a donc grandement contribue a la multiplication des modeles informatiques.   Nous nous interesserons au modele systolique et au modele parallele a gros grains baptise (Coarse Grained Multicomputers). Le modele CGM a ete propose par F. Dehne et al. et il possede des proprietes qui le rendent tres interessant d'un point de vue pratique. Il est parfaitement adapte a la modelisation des architectures existantes pour lesquelles le nombre de processeurs peut etre de plusieurs milliers et la taille des donnees peut atteindre plusieurs milliards d'octets. Un algorithme developpe pour ce modele est constitue de calculs locaux utilisant, si possible, des algorithmes sequentiels optimaux et de rondes de communication dont le nombre doit etre independant de la taille des donnees a traiter. Le modele CGM est donc tres interessant d'un point de vue economique. En effet, ce modele est independant des architectures reelles et permet de reutiliser des algorithmes sequentiels efficaces, ce qui le rend tres portable.   Dans cette these nous nous interessons a des problemes d'algorithmique du texte. Ces problemes peuvent ameliorer la compression de donnees ou bien etre utilises en bio-informatique. Ainsi, nous proposons des solutions CGM aux problemes de recherche de la plus longue sous-suite croissante, de la plus longue sous-suite commune a deux mots, du plus long suffixe repete en chaque caractere d'un mot et de repetitions. Pour cela, nous sommes partis de solutions systoliques existantes que nous avons adaptees au modele CGM. Le but de ce travail est en fait double. D'une part, nous proposons pour la premiere fois des solutions CGM a ces quatre problemes. D'autre part, nous montrons comment des solutions systoliques peuvent etre derivees en algorithmes CGM. En effet, de nombreux problemes ont ete etudies sur des architectures systoliques, c'est a dire des machines dediees, non reutilisables pour d'autres problemes. Le modele CGM quant a lui permet de travailler avec des machines peu couteuses et reutilisables a souhaits.

{"abstract": "Nowadays, blogs are regarded as standard text-based communication tools on the internet. In contrast to traditional web pages, the blog has several significant features: it allows authoring via a web browser, and offers automatic backlink requesting, called trackback. The latter provides direct communication between blog servers. In this paper, we propose a distributed computation method based on trackback communication and present the implementation of a software verification system based on distributed computing. The software verification system consists of ordinary blog systems which are used as frontend interfaces, and verification blog bots which are used as backend inference engines. One of the prominent features is that one can limit the danger of intrusion into vulnerable verifier programs to the private networks where the verification blog bots are operated.", "authors": ["Takayuki Sasajima", "Shin-ya Nishizaki"], "n_citation": 50, "references": [], "title": "Blog-Based distributed computation: implementation of software verification system", "venue": "", "year": 2012, "id": "2df218e6-e626-4135-a994-13cae04f6bde"}

The evaluation is mostly based on subjective appreciation with no explicit consideration of difficulty factors. However, in a computerized environment for mathematics instruction it would be highly beneficial to dispose of such explicit factors and automated assessment of problem difficulty. In the present paper a set of factors for sequence problems in analysis are proposed. For the automated detection of these factors a set of rules was defined.

{"abstract": "The Generate-and-Solve is a hybrid framework to cope with hard combinatorial optimization problems by artificially reducing the search space of solutions. In this framework, a metaheuristic engine works as a generator of reduced instances of the problem. These instances, in turn, can be more easily handled by an exact solver to provide a feasible (optimal) solution to the original problem. This approach has commonly employed genetic algorithms and it has been particularly effective in dealing with cutting and packing problems. In this paper, we present an instantiation of the framework for tackling the constrained two-dimensional non-guillotine cutting problem and the container loading problem using a simulated annealing generator. We conducted computational experiments on a set of difficult benchmark instances. Results show that the simulated annealing implementation overachieves previous versions of the Generate-and-Solve framework.

{"abstract": "A VLSI sorter of sizeO(n) can sortn elements in linear time when the input and output time are taken into account. If the input contains more thann elements, some prepocessing has to be performed. A VLSI partition algorithm that provides a solution to this problem is presented. The algorithm partitions the input data into two smaller parts as the quicksort algorithm does. That is, the elements of the first part will be smaller than the elements of the second part. The partition is repeated until the parts are small enough to fit in the sorter. It is shown that the average number of times each element must go through the partitioner isO(logk) for a data file of sizekn wheren is the size of the sorter. In the worst case where the partitioner fails to divide the input evenly, the elements must goO(k) times through the partitioner like in the quicksort algorithm. The partitioner can also be used, with simple modifications, as a sorter, a stack, a queue, or as a priority queue. Other advantages of the VLSI algorithm are also discussed.", "authors": ["Shou-Hsuan Stephen Huang"], "n_citation": 0, "references": ["224ab868-2c68-4041-a533-a46fdad013b0", "71671678-81df-46f9-8de6-7c76920225cc", "c6dd1a99-5028-4e82-a8a6-1aaa04ada2bf"], "title": "A VLSI partition algorithm", "venue": "Bit Numerical Mathematics", "year": 1988, "id": "2ef6b82c-54cb-4972-a6db-e3520efc68d7"}

{"abstract": "We propose an in-home living activity recognition method using only off-the-shelf sensors, namely, an accelerometer and a microphone, which are commonly applied in mobile phones. The proposed method firstly estimates a user's movement condition roughly by acceleration sensing. Secondly, it classifies the working condition in detail by acoustic sensing when it estimates the condition to be working by acceleration sensing. We developed a prototype system to recognize the user's living activity in real time and conducted two experiments to confirm the feasibility of the proposed method. As a result of the first experiment, three movement conditions; quiet, walking, and working, are classified with more than 95% accuracy by acceleration sensing. And it classified working into seven conditions with 85.9% accuracy by acoustic sensing. Moreover, the result of the second experiment shows that it is effective to adopt instance-based recognition according to the assumed application.", "authors": ["Kazushige Ouchi", "Miwako Doi"], "n_citation": 4, "references": ["448fcf27-5265-4c92-8ae7-3841f58a6955", "511f1560-26c6-49b0-9c86-ef20b370de72", "85061d0b-6200-4af6-8358-07bf4e634dea", "9764ba3f-b269-4bd9-a89e-54ad8bf2e72b", "b6dd1973-46bb-4b4f-b097-a5803d4e22f8", "df78dbad-a315-4f24-9933-525529bce43f"], "title": "A real-time living activity recognition system using off-the-shelf sensors on a mobile phone", "venue": "Contexts", "year": 2011, "id": "30d6644e-dfad-45b7-96b6-6926fcb62080"}
{"abstract": "Location Based Services (LBS) are evolving very fast but despite this are still at an early phase of their evolution. The future LBS services will be more anticipatory of users needs and will exploit a broader range of information on users. In order to anticipate users' needs, LBS providers should be able to understand users' behaviours, preferences and interests automatically and with- out asking the user to specify them. Then using the user's current situation and previously extracted behaviours, interests and dislikes, the user's needs can be predicted at the relevant moment and provide the most appropriate sets of ser- vices. This paper shows the application of data mining techniques over anony- mous sets of tracking data to recognise mobility behaviours and preferences of users such as Point of Interest (PoI). Tracking data are first anonymised then stored in a spatio-temporal database. Then, using data mining techniques, rules, models and patterns are recognised.

In this paper, the diffusion process of the two LEOS systems is analyzed under competition. We simulate the diffusion process under different scenarios. In these scenarios, we analyze issues related to the timing of product introduction, technology advantage and potential customer base. A model of the potential customer base with network externality is presented. We found that the timing of product introduction can have significant impact on the follower in the market. We found that a follower firm with more advanced technology would have higher probability to succeed in competing against the first mover. In addition, the increase in the potential customer base favors the firm with advanced technology. The network externality effect in the growth of the customer base favors both firms but could be an barrier for the follower to create a critical mass and beat the incumbent firm.", "authors": ["Kemal Altinkemer", "Wei T.

{"abstract": "The long-rising number of electronic control units (ECUs) in cars is a major problem for OEMs, because of high costs and installation space requirements. The complexity could be reduced by the use of multi-core processors, where several ECUs can be repartitioned into virtual machines (VMs) running on one multi-core processor. Such a consolidation of ECUs is challenging, because I/O devices for real-time capable interconnects have to be shared by multiple VMs. In this paper we present a concept for offloading the functionality for CAN controller virtualization into a self-virtualized controller.

{"abstract": "Loose particles left inside aerospace components or equipment can cause catastrophic failure in aerospace industry. It is vital to identify the material type of these loose particles and eliminate them. This is a classification problem, and autoregressive (AR) model and Learning Vector Quantization (LVQ) networks have been used to classify loose particles inside components. More recently, the test objects have been changed from components to aerospace equipments. To improve classification accuracy, more data samples often have to be dealt with. The difficulty is that these data samples contain redundant information, and the aforementioned two conventional methods are unable to process redundant information, thus the classification accuracy is deteriorated. In this paper, the wavelet Fisher discriminant is investigated for loose particle classifications. First, the fisher model is formulated as a least squares problem with linear-in-the-parameters structure. Then, the previously proposed two-stage subset selection method is used to build a sparse wavelet Fisher model in order to reduce redundant information.

{"abstract": "Effective network coverage and operational life span is key concern of randomly deployed Wireless Sensor Network (WSN) for performing monitoring function in designated region. Intrinsically, WSN consists of resource constraints sensor nodes. For effective coverage, it is undesirable activating all deployed set of nodes for getting the desired degree of coverage if the same result can be obtained by activating a small subset of deployed nodes for providing the sensing function in the concerned region. We study the problem of extending the life span of the sensor network for fault tolerant area coverage. The proposed genetic algorithm based approach aims to cover a sensed area with minimum number of active nodes and compute the maximum number of Sensing Cover Set (SCS) so that network life time can be prolonged by calculating the working schedule of cover set. Each SCS has been assigned the cover set ID. Each SCS works for the specified amount of time in an alternate fashion. Simulation experiment indicates that genetic algorithm based approach is able to optimally partition the nodes into different SCS.", "authors": ["Rameshwar Nath Tripathi", "Shekhar Verma", "S. V.

{"abstract": "Location based services are becoming an emerging market due to technological advances achieved both at GSM phone operators and the multimedia nature of the mobile handsets. In this paper, a new methodology of mobile positioning integrating both GSM network using signal strengths and GPS readings in the light of an assisted GPS based approach. The methodology employs an extended Kalman filter approach in which the stochastic errors related to various measurements are appropriately characterized and modeled. The methodology uses Netmonitor software to retrieve network information including signal strength and cell-identities of various base transmitter stations (BTS). The distance from the mobile station (MS) to each BTS is therefore determined using Hata-Okumura radio propagation model. The different distances and the GPS readings are therefore combined in the framework of extended static Kalman filter. Once positioning is achieved, a .NET like application is implemented to access the Microsoft MapPoint Web Service, via the Internet (http protocol), which visualises the mobile's location on a map, finds nearby points of interest (POI) and computes routes between them. In order to demonstrate the feasibility of the proposal, experiment is carried out in Birmingham area and compared to the result yielded by the commercial software of MobileLocate Ltd. An accuracy of less than 70 meters has been achieved, which shows substantial improvement over standard Timing Advance related techniques and the commercial software.", "authors": ["Sadek Hamani", "Mourad Oussalah", "Peter Hall"], "n_citation": 50, "references": [], "title": "Combination of GSM and GPS signals for Mobile Positioning and Location Service Using Kalman Filter.", "venue": "world congress on engineering", "year": 2007, "id": "32583a95-d87c-45ca-a7f8-523efa8338fa"}

{"abstract": "With the increasing size of web data and widely adopted parallel cloud computing paradigm, distributed database and other distributed data processing systems, for example Pregel and GraphLab, use data partitioning technology to divide the large data set. By default, these systems use hash partitioning to randomly assign data to partitions, which leads to huge network traffic between partitions. Fine-grained partitioning can better allocate data and minimize the number of nodes involved within a transaction or job while balancing the workload across data nodes as well. In this paper, we propose a novel prototype system, Lute, to provide highly efficient fine-grained partitioning scheme for these distributed systems. Lute maintains a lookup table for each partitioned data set that maps a key to a set of partition ID(s). We use a novel lookup table technology that provides low cost of reading and writing lookup table. Lute provides transaction support and high concurrency writing with Multi Version Concurrency Control (MVCC) as well.   We implemented a prototype distributed DBMS on Postgresql and used Lute as a middle-ware to provide fine-grained partitioning support. Extensive experiments conducted on a cluster demonstrate the advantage of the proposed approach. The evaluation results show that in comparison with other state-of-the-art lookup table salutations, our approach can significantly improve throughput by about 20% to 70% on TPC-C benchmark.", "authors": ["Ning Xu"], "n_citation": 1, "references": ["12b5f05e-19e3-42ba-82e5-030ad311e3ae", "425ef4cd-313d-4559-b97d-2539022e51eb", "526789d7-2b83-44d7-8956-4bd0814f2189", "62416ed8-212e-4911-9348-f82d8477154c", "74e65052-3f72-4f4c-8899-c62715b68dac", "7f52f2f6-74e0-4fe2-8671-9edae50c6c35", "e2a02781-401a-48bf-a12e-a48ac4ef4432", "fa619312-6a30-40c5-bd8e-f09dffce0543"], "title": "Fine-grained data partitioning framework for distributed database systems", "venue": "international world wide web conferences", "year": 2014, "id": "32a04b21-acb9-4708-8da3-154d8e851b4a"}

{"abstract": "Mach bands are the pronounced light and dark bands visible where a luminance plateau meets a ramp as in a penumbra. A great deal of effort has been devoted to study these in order to understand the underlying neural circuitry. A number of theoretical models, linear and non-linear, have consequently been proposed starting from the seminal studies of Ernst Mach himself. In this work we demonstrate why no linear model of visual perception can explain the Mach band illusion although many such attempts have been made starting from that of Mach to some recent ones. From the same approach, we also systematically demonstrate why the Mach bands are weak or inexistent at step changes of intensity. A new aspect, viz. the scaling properties of the widths of Mach band has been studied to provide a unified approach to solve both these problems in vision.", "authors": ["Ashish Bakshi", "Kuntal Ghosh"], "n_citation": 0, "references": ["0dfc1e91-cb58-4753-921d-6b67947e38fd", "2b93e280-10de-4883-a17c-68f416c157fb"], "title": "Scaling properties of mach bands and perceptual models", "venue": "", "year": 2012, "id": "32d3eba0-cda7-4eb8-b4e1-6a96c64068c3"}

{"abstract": "In a directed flow network we assign capacities on vertices as well as on edges. We consider a (\u03b4, \u03b7)-balanced flow problem of single commodity case. A (\u03b4, \u03b7)-balanced flow is defined as a flow such that the flow value at each edge is not more than \u03b4, \u010b f and the flow value at each vertex is not more than \u03b7 \u010b f, where f is the total amount of the flow. Based on (\u03b4, \u03b7)-balanced flow, the (\u03b4, \u03b7)- capacity is defined for a mixed cut in a network. A mixed cut in a network is a set of edges and vertices removal of those separates the network. Then the max-flow min-cut theorem for this (\u03b4, \u03b7)-balanced flow is proved for the single commodity case in a directed network. The theorem for (\u03b4, \u03b7)-balanced flow is not easily to be proved by only applying the max-flow min-cut theorem of ordinary flows. Then we show a method for evaluating the maximum (\u03b4, \u03b7)-balanced flow. The algorithm gives the maximum value of (\u03b4, \u03b7)-balanced flow between s and t in N with at most |V| \u010b |E| evaluations of maximum flow in a network, where V is the vertex set of N and E is the edge set of N, respectively. Each evaluations of the maximum flow is performed in N with altered capacities on edges and on vertices. We can apply all the results to undirected networks.", "authors": ["Wataru Kishimoto"], "n_citation": 50, "references": ["11cba3a2-8832-42a6-8027-c11c4a595d34", "1b41d9a0-3857-4fb6-b7ba-d39da73c04dd", "40e83483-0cf7-4af9-af5b-df0f85903260", "4e413a95-6a4e-4d06-bdfa-c7e8b190981a", "592b5465-d378-4a95-a58b-2882727efc9b", "7943047d-0d04-40a8-9c89-b79d1d03755f", "8285353b-138b-4dcf-a960-2e307d8e6fd1", "a6d12155-6e7b-4992-bdce-27f6e5ca2b20", "bd485cf3-2982-4fe3-be65-895f4878fcc1", "dc2381b4-fd0c-4b97-9e2f-7075c1c0f3c7", "f85ab39e-dccc-4117-9b0d-5aa5876753d8"], "title": "A method for obtaining the maximum (\u03b4, \u03b7)-balanced flow in a network", "venue": "", "year": 2011, "id": "3397b8e0-d09f-470c-a746-309dde822c33"}

{"abstract": "Estimation of Distribution Algorithms (EDAs) require flexible probability models that can be efficiently learned and sampled. Restricted Boltzmann Machines (RBMs) are generative neural networks with these desired properties. We integrate an RBM into an EDA and evaluate the performance of this system in solving combinatorial optimization problems with a single objective. We assess how the number of fitness evaluations and the CPU time scale with problem size and complexity. The results are compared to the Bayesian Optimization Algorithm (BOA), a state-of-the-art multivariate EDA, and the Dependency Tree Algorithm (DTA), which uses a simpler probability model requiring less computational effort for training the model. Although RBM\u2013EDA requires larger population sizes and a larger number of fitness evaluations than BOA, it outperforms BOA in terms of CPU times, in particular if the problem is large or complex. This is because RBM\u2013EDA requires less time for model building than BOA. DTA with its restricted model is a good choice for small problems but fails for larger and more difficult problems. These results highlight the potential of using generative neural networks for combinatorial optimization.", "authors": ["Malte Probst", "Franz Rothlauf", "J\u00f6rn Grahl"], "n_citation": 0, "references": ["018eb665-354d-4c90-a6f7-9711671fff0e", "0455679a-3b58-4d49-9201-71deccaea00f", "13f20a5b-b701-4083-95cf-1ae43bf28302", "17a6c30b-3b48-4246-8d34-b7c0212052ec", "19ee8d2a-1dca-40f7-bfb9-ad800108410e", "1af22edc-af0b-4539-9720-33b76466a068", "2090f4f6-ae88-4aa1-b078-4c203d5eb24c", "2d032539-3a12-4d9c-8723-cbb593b7b4ec", "312e18ce-76ed-4964-a03e-59d51e8671bf", "37a9e2f5-edd7-4d36-a01a-5adda693a5a7", "3da39db9-c58f-4ec4-8056-4b9463e2e879", "430acbd2-45ef-47c9-91e0-f5785658fa02", "4453fa3b-308f-472a-be61-65d1ce5c3de2", "48035b1b-b2ac-47a0-975e-1bbef6e396c5", "49e15f5d-44e6-47e9-b94b-db0291609b30", "4fb54171-f2d0-428a-a826-43a7a5d0d9a8", "62b6cf29-8074-4dbc-82d1-cac9fd40ab63", "63100618-a929-4b3f-bed4-4b51a487f1ee", "6a414f2d-2125-4ff2-98c1-e8231751bdfd", "6a6b9aa6-683f-4c7c-b06e-9c3018d10fd3", "6b605105-c55a-4d99-b3b0-2c4924e36988", "6dd62e22-a626-45b8-b686-6e6d647b1179", "6ebf5506-5b54-431b-8a4f-f90e4622d630", "70f4f89a-a7ed-430d-b149-81e5cc6a7610", "717d6a25-0da0-4134-84a9-4bc18d822bdf", "7aa454b2-47c6-4117-b823-1df65289e8e7", "83f9cd35-3885-47ba-90d3-42ad44563553", "89f10062-acf1-4171-b882-f3222c3a357e", "8e2d5908-b081-48af-b896-a7d24fced952", "9e7d5d76-e050-4873-bb11-feb35db765ee", "a8146c80-d1a2-4d06-866b-719dd4048e8c", "ae22966a-0564-44bc-9be2-3d5111b1a6bd", "c411de16-9084-4bf4-b192-81fdf64af622", "cc97888b-86b5-4c55-ac8a-e1321779d87b", "cdafb83b-4b7c-4276-88fd-aba2e6fc3edd", "cfa3c687-2753-470a-9ff8-3e07dd7dd0cf", "cff535d0-5cea-4ef6-9fd1-21338b33752c", "d6903719-3dd6-4d33-a4fa-95b473539dc7", "e4b468aa-2b23-4229-8872-f9286464a19f", "eb67c40d-674c-4229-80d0-9da8965c506d", "eea790f8-29ea-4136-8fb2-95a955ea51f9", "f3fda42d-2a78-4b65-b9e1-c28378dbe84c", "f6102128-ce04-4998-bc36-8ceb253a8eff", "f8431861-d556-41ea-b826-b43a05878caf", "fa1f216b-1841-4430-9aab-614723afc42d", "fd1d065e-4a4b-430a-a1c5-e549a6843b21", "ff4538b7-12dc-457a-b2a7-9a74a36a8538"], "title": "Scalability of using Restricted Boltzmann Machines for Combinatorial Optimization", "venue": "European Journal of Operational Research", "year": 2017, "id": "34066529-0350-49aa-bfa4-31561cbf3c9f"}

{"abstract": "We present a fully-automated, model based, multilayer cache partitioning scheme for multiprogram workloads running on multicore machines. As opposed to prior efforts, this scheme partitions shared caches at multiple layers simultaneously in a coordinated fashion. This scheme tries to achieve two objectives. First, it tries to satisfy the specified quality of service (QoS) values for all applications by partitioning the shared cache hierarchy across them, and second, it distributes the remaining excess cache capacity (if any) across applications such that a global performance metric is maximized. Our experimental analysis shows that the proposed multilayer partitioning scheme generates, on average, 33.1% improvement (on the weighted speedup metric) over the next best-performing scheme and is very successful in satisfying the QoS requirements of applications. Also, we show that partitioning each layer in isolation cannot generate the benefits obtained through our coordinated partitioning scheme. In addition, we observed that the difference between our scheme and an optimal scheme (that derives best dynamic partitions) was less than 15% for all the workloads tested and 6.6% on average.", "authors": ["Mahmut T.

{"abstract": "Traditional methods on video summarization are designed to generate summaries for single-view video records, and thus they cannot fully exploit the mutual information in multi-view video records. In this paper, we present a multi-view metric learning framework for multi-view video summarization. It combines the advantages of maximum margin clustering with the disagreement minimization criterion. The learning framework thus has the ability to find a metric that best separates the input data, and meanwhile to force the learned metric to maintain underlying intrinsic structure of data points, for example geometric information. Facilitated by such a framework, a systematic solution to the multi-view video summarization problem is developed from the viewpoint of metric learning.

{"abstract": "Reconstructing binary matrices from their row, column, diagonal, and antidiagonal sums (also called projections) plays a central role in discrete tomography. One of the main difficulties in this task is that in certain cases the projections do not uniquely determine the binary matrix. This can yield an extremely large number of (sometimes very different) solutions. This ambiguity can be reduced by having some prior knowledge about the matrix to be reconstructed. The main challenge here is to find classes of binary matrices where ambiguity is drastically reduced or even completely eliminated. The goal of this paper is to study the class of hv-convex matrices which have decomposable configurations from the viewpoint of ambiguity. First, we give a negative result in the case of three projections. Then, we present a heuristic for the reconstruction using four projections and analyze its performance in quality and running time.", "authors": ["P\u00e9ter Bal\u00e1zs"], "n_citation": 7, "references": ["52114c6c-1019-4c10-9670-4d6e7b770603", "6650eab0-31a0-41a1-9db8-0c7467e6cd11", "6ff07323-50eb-48e1-99e4-740e2bbfc443", "7510895c-71e0-4378-ad0b-8d33651c799b", "aafb43fa-783c-4998-bfb0-0ebd421c334b", "d1f31b28-597b-491d-8bb1-54b8dff1d76e", "d567631f-687b-49ce-9033-dddd43e18221", "e18ea4a3-29b4-4472-92d5-9c837fba42c5"], "title": "On the ambiguity of reconstructing hv-convex binary matrices with decomposable configurations", "venue": "Acta Cybernetica", "year": 2008, "id": "34d5f23a-4e81-4ec4-94b6-c103a0e19d78"}
{"abstract": "In this paper, we address the lexicon design problem in Turkish large vocabulary speech recognition. Although we focus only on Turkish, the methods described here are general enough that they can be considered for other agglutinative languages like Finnish, Korean etc. In an agglutinative language, several words can be created from a single root word using a rich collection of morphological rules. So, a virtually infinite size lexicon is required to cover the language if words are used as the basic units. The standard approach to this problem is to discover a number of primitive units so that a large set of words can be created by compounding those units. Two broad classes of methods are available for splitting words into their sub-units; morphology-based and data-driven methods. Although the word splitting significantly reduces the out of vocabulary rate, it shrinks the context and increases acoustic confusibility. We have used two methods to address the latter. In one method, we use word counts to avoid splitting of high frequency lexical units, and in the other method, we recompound splits according to a probabilistic measure. We present experimental results that show the methods are very effective to lower the word error rate at the expense of lexicon size.", "authors": ["Kadri Hacioglu", "Bryan L.

{"abstract": "In this paper, we present a software keyboard called Ley- board that enables users to type faster. Leyboard makes typing easier by placing keys at the positions of fingers and their surroundings. To this end, Leyboard automatically adjusts its key positions and sizes to users' hands. This design allows users to type faster and more accurately than using ordinary software keyboards, the keys of which are unperceptive. We have implemented a prototype and have performed a long-term user study.

{"abstract": "Social network games in Facebook are played by millions of players on daily basis. Due to their design characteristics, new challenges for game design and playability evaluations arise. We present a study where 18 novice inspectors evaluated a social game using playability heuristics. The objective is to explore possible domain-specific playability problems and to examine how the established heuristics suit for evaluating social games. The results from this study show that some implementations of the social games design characteristics can cause playability problems and that the established heuristics are suitable for evaluating social games.

{"abstract": "This paper explores the feasibility of constructing a document relevance calculating model based on lexical cohesion with structure analysis. In this model, by extracting the semanticrelative word clusters in documents according to the lexicon cohesion principle, documents are formalized in expressions which are composed of lexicon chains with structure information. And based on this kind of representation, document relevance calculation is substituted by semantic distance calculation of lexical chains. The feasibility of this novel approach has been examined by experiments conducted on Chinese Library Classification (CLC) dataset. The results show that the method makes good use of the background knowledge of ordinary users, and it is an effective method for relevance calculation of documents.", "authors": ["Yuming Zhao", "Bingquan Liu", "Xiaolong Wang"], "n_citation": 50, "references": ["0c4aa9b4-f955-4836-b8dc-1ca2dc92ab2e", "67288135-af65-4979-99ef-75e7d603e190", "708f92bc-9eb0-4a03-9c1e-1e54b3261eb9", "909b9060-0701-47c3-8abc-8455351e88fb", "e0164854-5b82-4502-bd31-a1580b8a931a"], "title": "Document relevance calculation based on Lexical cohesion with structure analysis.", "venue": "Journal of Chinese Language and Computing", "year": 2008, "id": "3664e43c-aeb0-47c3-ba0e-7f1e70bb2cfe"}

{"abstract": "Cluster analysis is one area of machine learning of particular interest to data mining. It provides for the organization of a collection of patterns, represented as a vector in a multidimensional space, into clusters based on the similarity of these patterns. Medical decision support is also of increasing research interest. Ongoing collaborations between cardiovascular clinicians and computer science are looking at the application of neural networks, and in particular clustering, to the area of individual patient diagnosis, based on clinical records. The cardiovascular domain is characterized as a mixture of continuous and discrete data. This limits the use of the K-means algorithm, which is widely used for partitioning clusters in data mining.

{"abstract": "Choosing a good variable order is crucial for making symbolic state-space generation algorithms truly efficient. One such algorithm is the MDD-based Saturation algorithm for Petri nets implemented in SmArT, whose efficiency relies on exploiting event locality.#R##N##R##N#This paper presents a novel, static ordering heuristic that considers place invariants of Petri nets. In contrast to related work, we use the functional dependencies encoded by invariants to merge decision-diagram variables, rather than to eliminate them. We prove that merging variables always yields smaller MDDs and improves event locality, while eliminating variables may increase MDD sizes and break locality. Combining this idea of merging with heuristics for maximizing event locality, we obtain an algorithm for static variable order which outperforms competing approaches regarding both time-efficiency and memory-efficiency, as we demonstrate by extensive benchmarking.", "authors": ["Gianfranco Ciardo", "Gerald L\u00fcttgen", "Andy Jinqing Yu"], "n_citation": 19, "references": ["04a516e7-0cc9-4783-aae0-4c76ca7c61e4", "05aed872-1d9b-4a3e-80c6-d5a004d90230", "0757710e-2b31-4e3a-9413-d90fbaab1cce", "0d4485d7-5db4-4001-a3f5-3ab5677ba00c", "0ed8c347-0774-4a51-9d64-47b847d8897a", "16e0969d-e059-4216-bccc-6da8127ac2c4", "18f27076-289e-4bd1-93bc-fd059e603e66", "1ac7e02c-0b35-408f-8c0a-250ddb376db7", "29597bd7-43bd-4d38-89f8-cc2393958ccc", "3efc96b8-643a-48d7-8c3f-1e832ece3811", "41a523c5-25a1-4b2f-bd6f-20edaa601018", "478bd8c1-2518-4742-92d9-6da2d3754884", "52d4e359-081d-417c-a398-c081c351c7ea", "59017aa0-f73b-4a69-87ca-457fa1d2504e", "6d5a95c6-6907-4d34-b942-fc6c74f6b994", "75e7134e-9434-47f9-8804-b5eca00680d9", "88216e1e-e037-4f80-976e-6459b98ff099", "975f93fb-3274-493c-be18-81998544e5e0", "9849d9c4-a97f-452f-882c-42a8c6cab0b5", "99216410-e85b-4f34-b89d-c6785c5b7686", "a8e0f15b-63ca-4edc-86e2-8f577a9388d5", "ac81d787-5bac-4f20-ab5b-e231046fa6d8", "b01db01a-b38f-47fc-8207-be8d4600fcf2", "b05f1793-9c2c-40db-9d1b-037ef94107be", "d1616cec-8c7a-4a03-9a9f-d7f176075d46", "d4418609-fffe-4cc9-ad42-3b5f245f2d12", "da3faf06-2485-4386-a820-a8b708400067", "debc553a-5618-4ffe-8d2c-ce454fb00ec7", "e3f92aa8-6ca2-4fe0-babe-da31345f9466", "e4cfd64a-1cb6-426c-b1be-0c55c349d0a4", "e7af69f3-4105-4401-9edd-a0b13f50761b", "f863a45a-8af0-4369-aee6-6d74e05a73a9"], "title": "Improving static variable orders via invariants", "venue": "applications and theory of petri nets", "year": 2007, "id": "37b003c9-9226-4cda-b6d7-f57b978cc422"}

{"abstract": "A semantic feature for statistical machine translation, based on Latent Semantic Indexing, is proposed and evaluated. The objective of the proposed feature is to account for the degree of similarity between a given input sentence and each individual sentence in the training dataset. This similarity is computed in a reduced vector-space constructed by means of the Latent Semantic Indexing decomposition. The computed similarity values are used as an additional feature in the log-linear model combination approach to statistical machine translation. In our implementation, the proposed feature is dynamically adjusted for each translation unit in the translation table according to the current input sentence to be translated. This model aims at favoring those translation units that were extracted from training sentences that are semantically related to the current input sentence being translated. Experimental results on a Spanish-to-English translation task on the Bible corpus demonstrate a significant improvement on translation quality with respect to a baseline system.", "authors": ["Rafael E.

{"abstract": "Using Bayesian networks (BNs) for classification tasks has received significant attention as BNs can encode and represent domain-experts' knowledge as well as data in their structures and conditional probability tables. While structure learning and constructing the structure by hand according to an ensemble of domain-expert opinions are two common approaches to make a BN structure, finding an optimal structure to attain a high correct classification rate -especially for high dimensional problems- is still a challenging task. In this paper we propose a framework - called Local Bayesian Network Experts Fusion (LoBNEF) - in that, instead of making a single network, multiple Bayesian Network Classifiers (BNCs) are built and their outputs are attentively fused. The attentive fusion process is learned interactively using a Bayesian reinforcement learning method. We demonstrate that learning different BNCs in the first step and then fusing their decisions in an attentive and sequential manner is an efficient and robust method in terms of correct classification rate.", "authors": ["Sepehr Eghbali", "Majid Nili Ahmadabadi", "Babak Nadjar Araabi", "Maryam S.

In this work, we developed an efficient approach to find visual similarities between images that runs completely on GPU and is applicable to large image databases. Based on local self-similarity descriptors, the approach finds similarities even across modalities. Given a set of images, a database is created by storing all descriptors in an arrangement suitable for parallel GPU-based comparison. A novel voting-scheme further considers the spatial layout of descriptors with hardly any overhead. Thousands of images are searched in only a few seconds.

{"abstract": "Merging operators aim at defining the beliefs/goals of a group of agents from the beliefs/goals of each member of the group. Whenever an agent of the group has preferences over the possible results of the merging process (i.e. the possible merged bases), she can try to rig the merging process by lying on her true beliefs/goals if this leads to a better merged base according to her point of view. Obviously, strategy-proof operators are highly desirable in order to guarantee a fair merging process even when some of them are not sincere. In fact, when strategy-proofness is not guaranteed, it may be questioned whether the result of the merging process actually represents the beliefs/goals of the group. In this paper, the strategy-proof landscape for many merging operators from the literature, including model-based ones and formula-based ones, is drawn.

{"abstract": "A key challenge in multi-robot teaming research is determining how to properly enable robots to make decisions on actions they should take to contribute to the overall system objective. This article discusses how many forms of decision making in multi-robot teams can be formulated as optimization problems. In particular, we examine the common multi-robot capabilities of task allocation, path planning, formation generation, and target tracking/observation, showing how each can be represented as optimization problems. Of course, globally optimal solutions to such formulations are not possible, as it is well-known that such problems are intractable. However, many researchers have successfully built solutions that are approximations to the global problems, which work well in practice. While we do not argue that all decision making in multi-robot systems should be based on optimization formulations, it is instructive to study when this technique is appropriate. Future development of new approximation algorithms to well-known global optimization problems can therefore have an important positive impact for many applications in multi-robot systems.", "authors": ["Lynne E.

{"abstract": "We are interested in the following general question: is it possible to abstract knowledge that is generated while learning the solution of a problem, so that this abstraction can accelerate the learning process? Moreover, is it possible to transfer and reuse the acquired abstract knowledge to accelerate the learning process for future similar tasks? We propose a framework for conducting simultaneously two levels of reinforcement learning, where an abstract policy is learned while learning of a concrete policy for the problem, such that both policies are refined through exploration and interaction of the agent with the environment. We explore abstraction both to accelerate the learning process for an optimal concrete policy for the current problem, and to allow the application of the generated abstract policy in learning solutions for new problems. We report experiments in a robot navigation environment that show our framework to be effective in speeding up policy construction for practical problems and in generating abstractions that can be used to accelerate learning in new similar problems.", "authors": ["Marcelo Li Koga", "Valdinei Freire da Silva", "Fabio Gagliardi Cozman", "Anna Helena Reali Costa"], "n_citation": 50, "references": ["10562a3b-4600-4e3c-a123-c399606a282c", "14d153f3-6176-4f3b-9011-655a129605ba", "2960c73c-f6be-4be0-b5a7-245e621b4b3d", "29956b99-ab54-42e4-a7e5-809ee936e4e7", "2b3446b7-f984-4e77-806d-88195b544235", "3bd7e5ba-94fa-4c35-b630-7d847b70497d", "41de0c82-c218-4c6c-a326-df6ca6173f8b", "4abe9362-c07d-415f-ba60-311481ffc2f9", "80d7f99c-e374-47a4-9c13-41f9480e85ce", "843da64a-484e-47d2-b167-5a219f18a890", "94ac13bc-b9da-4d36-a1fc-02ead34dff1f", "b46c8398-7943-4951-b219-03adde2a6fce", "c6f48732-851c-42a3-a175-c97161b28203", "cac1d48f-df84-49fe-bb2d-25ccee389e3c", "e0734956-0750-4112-916d-19a071a9cfeb", "f11c51c5-54c1-42f1-8377-c8ef4b471ae3", "fe630479-8a7e-45dd-8d11-4905abca39e1"], "title": "Speeding-up reinforcement learning through abstraction and transfer learning", "venue": "adaptive agents and multi agents systems", "year": 2013, "id": "3cbbf880-7d73-4825-87c5-85fe61047387"}

{"abstract": "Human identification becomes huge demand in particular for the security related areas, in particular for the network security. EEG signals are confidential and hard to imitate, since EEG signals are a reflection of individual-dependent inner mental tasks. Generally speaking, it has several advantages, such as (i) it is confidential as it corresponds to a mental task, (ii) it is very difficult to mimic and (iii) it is almost impossible to steal as the brain activity is sensitive to the stress and the mood of the person, an aggressor cannot force the person to reproduce his/her mental pass-phrase. In this paper we first proposed a novel algorithm to create a spatial pattern of EEG signals obtained from the open public database. In our EEG signal processing, we have analyzed 64-electrode EEG samples for two databases, one is for 45 people and calculate the equivalent root mean square (rms) values for each electrode signal over 1 second period, by which created a 64-value input for each subject. With this neural network (NN) model, our analysis clearly showed that our designed classifier is able to identify all the 45 people correctly (successful rate of 100%) with a mean square error of 2.0334\u00d710 -7 and the same algorithm applying to the", "authors": ["Xu Huang", "Salahiddin Altahat", "Dat Tran", "Li Shutao"], "n_citation": 1, "references": ["2c0640d9-680c-4e5e-942e-257187e52d03", "65d0cf5e-a36a-432e-b730-e1ef8d0b16e1", "821c62e6-d90f-452b-8782-0665e870f902", "a636f20b-5efe-4496-9b4b-8eb763bc3274", "d9c3061f-da12-44d5-b17f-a681f59217d4", "f3267c01-b670-4b7a-a3a5-79088c0d90ab"], "title": "Human Identification with Electroencephalogram (EEG) for the Future Network Security", "venue": "network and system security", "year": 2013, "id": "3dd90abb-44a5-4977-abb4-fbcfe6a7d1f0"}

{"abstract": "The classical setting of community detection consists of networks exhibiting a clustered structure. To more accurately model real systems we consider a class of networks (i) whose edges may carry labels and (ii) which may lack a clustered structure. Specifically we assume that nodes possess latent attributes drawn from a general compact space and edges between two nodes are randomly generated and labeled according to some unknown distribution as a function of their latent attributes. Our goal is then to infer the edge label distributions from a partially observed network. We propose a computationally efficient spectral algorithm and show it allows for asymptotically correct inference when the average node degree could be as low as logarithmic in the total number of nodes. Conversely, if the average node degree is below a specific constant threshold, we show that no algorithm can achieve better inference than guessing without using the observations. As a byproduct of our analysis, we show that our model provides a general procedure to construct random graph models with a spectrum asymptotic to a pre-specified eigenvalue distribution such as a power-law distribution.", "authors": ["Jiaming Xu", "Laurent Massouli\u00e9", "Marc Lelarge"], "n_citation": 28, "references": ["25ae3db6-aa98-401a-aea7-839ba1c1f740", "261f4414-be4d-46c5-b420-187c15a6b8e1", "266fe2bc-554f-4292-a300-76d23df5376e", "4f8a4890-9178-4781-a5d4-0e665b6d91d0", "528c9f9d-b50b-4bc3-9aa1-2706b4a61b2c", "5ccdf1db-7eee-435b-99c2-890b854823f3", "68faab18-b537-4f62-85cf-ddc9ef352362", "6fbc185a-1319-46e0-9f4f-662fce6108f2", "74001657-3647-4740-9147-e47caeedb567", "8ebe0f82-69b0-439b-ae45-64c7b32b1099", "98da593f-2756-4d08-b67b-f8c610f41354", "c8e9672d-bfcf-4568-8d8d-d390510a7257", "ee3f88de-8b7e-4dcc-b1db-94c9e5e6af25", "ee64ae0c-317a-45ba-99da-d9e46d182a1a", "f99a6b3a-0980-4a9e-bbce-f9397c45106f", "fda3ad4e-5c89-4cbb-ac3c-f3ad85c9a245"], "title": "Edge Label Inference in Generalized Stochastic Block Models: from Spectral Theory to Impossibility Results", "venue": "computational learning theory", "year": 2014, "id": "3e701daa-75ad-44d4-a29c-78122b537197"}

{"abstract": "This economic analysis of farmers' voluntary adoption of water quality management alternatives integrates three biophysical simulators to predict crop yields and soil erosion/water quality impacts under uncertain weather and market conditions. Farmers' willingness to cost\u2010share was used to estimate expectations of net returns and associated water and soil pollution based upon government cost\u2010share scenarios. Simulations integrated into mathematical programming results indicate that irrigation and nitrogen fertilizer applications do not alter water quality in the Gum Creek Watershed as much as generally anticipated. Under limited government payments, pollution abatement through reduction of irrigation and/or nitrogen fertilizer applications significantly reduces farmers' net revenues and hence, without threats of other regulatory means, more farmers opt out of a voluntary program. Abatement of nitrogen runoff and leaching should consider other management alternatives and include non\u2010agricultural sources of pollution.

{"abstract": "Users interested in biological and biomedical information sets on the semantic web are frequently not computer scientists. These researchers often find it difficult to use declarative query and view definition languages to manipulate these RDF data sets. We define a language IML consisting of a small number of graph transformations that can be composed in a dataflow style to transform RDF ontologies. The language's operations closely map to the high-level manipulations users undertake when transforming ontologies using a visual editor. To reduce the potentially high cost of evaluating queries over these transformations on demand, we describe a query rewriting engine for evaluating queries on IML views. The rewriter leverages IML's dataflow style and optimizations to eliminate unnecessary transformations in answering a query over an IML view. We evaluate our rewriter's performance on queries over use case view definitions on one or more biomedical ontologies.", "authors": ["Marianne Shaw", "Landon T. Detwiler", "James F.

{"abstract": "Health interventions vary widely. Pharmaceuticals, medical devices and wellness promotion are defined as \u2018outcome-centric.\u2019 They are implemented by clinicians for the use and benefit of consumers, and intervention effectiveness is measured by a change in health outcome. Electronic health records, computerized physician order entry systems and telehealth technologies are defined as \u2018delivery-centric.\u2019 They are implemented by organizations for use by clinicians to manage and facilitate consumer health, and the impact of these interventions on clinician workflow has become increasingly important. The methodological framework introduced in this paper uses a two-phase sequential mixed methods design that qualitatively explores clinician workflow before and after implementation of a delivery-centric intervention, and uses this information to quantitatively measure changes to workflow activities.

{"abstract": "One approach to manage collections is to create data about the things in it. This descriptive data is called metadata, and this term is in this thesis used as a collective noun, i.e no plural form exists. A library is a typical example of an organization that uses metadata, to manage a collection of books. The metadata about a book describes certain attributes of it, for example who the author is. Metadata also provides possibilities for a person to judge if a book is interesting without having to deal with the book itself. The metadata of the things in a collection is a representation of the collection that is easier to deal with than the collection itself. Nowadays metadata is often managed in computer-based systems that enable search possibilities and sorting of search results according to different principles. Metadata can be created both by computers and humans. This thesis will deal with certain aspects of the human activity of creating metadata and includes an explorative study of this activity. The increased amount of public information that is produced is also required to be easily accessible and therefore the situation when metadata is a part of the Semantic Web has been considered an important part of this thesis. This situation is also referred to as the Web of Data or Linked Data.With the Web of Data, metadata records living in isolation from each other can now be linked together over the web. This will probably change what kind of metadata that is being created, but also how it is being created. This thesis describes the construction and use of a framework called Annotation Profiles, a set of artifacts developed to enable an adaptable metadata creation environment with respect to what metadata that can be created. The main artifact is the Annotation Profile Model (APM), a model that holds enough information for a software application to generate a customized metadata editor from it. An instance of this model is called an annotation profile, that can be seen as a configuration for metadata editors. Changes to what metadata can be edited in a metadata editor can be done without modifying the code of the application. Two code libraries that implement the APM have been developed and have been evaluated both internally within the research group where they were developed, but also externally via interviews with software developers that have used one of the code-libraries. Another artifact presented is a protocol for how RDF metadata can be remotely updated when metadata is edited through a metadata editor. It is also described how the APM opens up possibilities for end user development and this is one of the avenues of pursuit in future research related to the APM.", "authors": ["Fredrik Enoksson"], "n_citation": 0, "title": "Adaptable metadata creation for the Web of Data", "venue": "", "year": 2014, "id": "3fc0d859-b99d-457a-a1ba-519560b3e0dc"}

{"abstract": "Media Independent Handover (MIH) is an emerging standard which supports the communication of network-critical events to upper layer mobility protocols. One of the key features of MIH is the event service, which supports predictive network degradation events that are triggered based on link layer metrics. For set route vehicles, the constrained nature of movement enables a degree of network performance prediction. We propose to capture this performance predictability through a Traffic Route Adapted Weighted Learning (TRAWL) algorithm. TRAWL is a feed forward neural network whose output layer is configurable for both homogeneous and heterogeneous networks. TRAWL uses an unsupervised back propagation learning mechanism, which captures predictable network behavior while also considering dynamic performance characteristics. We evaluate the performance of TRAWL using a commercial metropolitan heterogeneous network. We show that TRAWL has significant performance improvements over existing MIH link triggering mechanisms.", "authors": ["Enda Fallon", "Liam Murphy", "John Murphy", "Chi Ma"], "n_citation": 50, "references": ["369e1ef1-2e5c-4620-9e44-a05cf6b927e5", "3f913d8b-a155-4597-a948-e17e95453ac3", "46f98cd1-f49a-452d-9b95-37d6425e066b", "61b9cfce-4cf1-40ce-9b84-d30d6fed97fc", "8ec34d7b-617f-4c25-8a21-c03b585f0e3f", "a029b52a-02fb-4ae5-b8c6-6778f8ed3510", "c44b73c1-9bcc-47cc-a26f-091f37311ca3", "fc2a1c46-3b58-4d8f-9614-450ba4bfe703", "fdd391ab-17c7-424f-9080-f0e0384a8ca4"], "title": "TRAWL: a traffic route adapted weighted learning algorithm", "venue": "wired wireless internet communications", "year": 2011, "id": "4072e7ff-650c-44ab-9fe6-f764bf5547ec"}

Our weapons shall be two classical results known for decades. One is max volume min (s,t)-cuts by [Ford and Fulkerson, Flows in Networks. Princeton University Press, 1962], and the other is isolating cuts by [Dahlhaus et al., The complexity of multiterminal cuts. SIAM J. Comp. 23(4), 1994]. We sharpen these old weapons with the help of submodular functions, and apply them to this problem, which enable us to design a more elaborated branching scheme on deciding whether a non-terminal vertex is with a terminal or not. This bounded search tree algorithm can be shown to run in $1.84^k\\cdot n^{{\\cal O}(1)}$, thereby breaking the $2^k\\cdot n^{{\\cal O}(1)}$ barrier. As a by-product, it gives a $1.36^k\\cdot n^{{\\cal O}(1)}$ algorithm for 3-terminal cut.

{"abstract": "Recently, the number of foreign residents and foreign visitors in Japan has been increasing every year. Consequently, the opportunities for communication amongst people whose native languages differ are increasing. In healthcare facilities, a paper-based multilingual interview sheet is used to facilitate communication between medical workers and foreign patients. However, this interview sheet has been found to be inadequate for such purposes. Moreover, Japanese medical workers find it difficult to understand the different languages written on a paper-based interview sheet. To resolve this problem, we have developed a multilingual interview-sheet composition system that uses parallel texts and machine translation. This system can convey essential patient information to a medical worker during consultation. The contributions of this study are as follows: (1) We have proposed a multilingual interview-sheet composition system that can be used for communication between medical workers and foreign patients. We have developed this system using both parallel texts and machine translation. (2) We showed that a patient is able to create a multilingual interview sheet using a parallel corpus and machine translation. (3) Because it may be difficult to indicate an affected area of the body using words alone, we suggest that affected areas be indicated by the user using a human-body image for more accurate communication.", "authors": ["Taku Fukushima", "Takashi Yoshino", "Aguri Shigeno"], "n_citation": 2, "references": ["4508bc06-2812-49bb-aa93-21023e2c000d", "fd2fe50c-4482-4114-ba5b-4a5e5c0aeddc"], "title": "Development of multilingual interview-sheet composition system to support multilingual communication in medical field", "venue": "", "year": 2011, "id": "41faea96-85a4-4623-ba48-88f52ba79ca8"}

{"abstract": "Growing needs for French closed-captioning of live TV broadcasts in Canada cannot be met only with stenography-based technology because of a chronic shortage of skilled stenographers. Using speech recognition for live closed-captioning, however, requires several specific problems to be solved, such as the need for low-latency real-time recognition, remote operation, automated model updates, and collaborative work. In this paper we describe our solutions to these problems and the implementation of a live captioning system based on the CRIM speech recognizer. We report results from field deployment in several projects. The oldest in operation has been broadcasting real-time closed-captions for more than 2 years.

{"abstract": "Components can be used to implement coarse-grained parallelism on large parallel systems. A parallel component is a piece of parallel code that can be executed in parallel on a set of processors or cores and has a predefined interface to be coupled with other components.

The interfaces are used for data exchange. More complex parallel programs are built up using parallel components and a flexible component interaction structure.#R##N##R##N#In this article, the programming with parallel components for designing efficient programs for parallel execution platforms with a distributed address space is discussed and a mechanism for the specification of parallel components with communication interfaces is presented.

{"abstract": "For a graph G = (V, E) and a color set C, let f : E \u2192 C be an edge-coloring of G which is not necessarily proper. Then, the graph G edge-colored by f is rainbow connected if every two vertices of G has a path in which all edges are assigned distinct colors. Chakraborty et al. defined the problem of determining whether the graph colored by a given edge-coloring is rainbow connected. Chen et al. introduced the vertex-coloring version of the problem as a variant, and we introduce the total-coloring version in this paper. We settle the precise computational complexities of all the three problems from two viewpoints, namely, graph diameters and certain graph classes. We also give FPT algorithms for the three problems on general graphs when parameterized by the number of colors in C; these results imply that all the three problems can be solved in polynomial time for any graph with n vertices if |C| = O(log n).", "authors": ["Kei Uchizawa", "Takanori Aoki", "Takehiro Ito", "Akira Suzuki", "Xiao Zhou"], "n_citation": 3, "references": ["0bdfb73c-76bb-43cf-bb4e-fd9fd68a8f69", "132554c4-cf87-4261-bb0f-bfaefe19ba77", "6f695e89-8d75-4629-9c14-a813044c247d", "b70c14fe-728c-47e4-b2ea-89d6dfb61265", "d5dfe354-6058-405d-9cec-3cb7b441072b", "d9144d3b-b6f6-4541-8167-37f8564d6c08", "f704519a-9f4e-4876-bf78-506e2fa9f4f6"], "title": "On the rainbow connectivity of graphs: complexity and FPT algorithms", "venue": "computing and combinatorics conference", "year": 2011, "id": "427eb74a-1566-41fe-ba29-b9e46c5d2654"}

{"abstract": "In Indexing with Gaps one seeks to index a text to allow pattern queries that allow gaps within the pattern query.

{"abstract": "Interval temporal logics provide a natural framework for temporal reasoning about interval structures over linearly ordered domains, where intervals are taken as the primitive ontological entities. The most influential propositional interval-based logic is probably Halpern and Shoham's Modal Logic of Time Intervals, a.k.a. HS. While most studies focused on the computational properties of the syntactic fragments that arise by considering only a subset of the set of modalities, the fragments that are obtained by weakening the propositional side have received very scarce attention. Here, we approach this problem by considering various sub-propositional fragments of HS, such as the so-called Horn, Krom, and core fragment. We prove that the Horn fragment of HS is undecidable on every interesting class of linearly ordered sets, and we briefly discuss the difficulties that arise when considering the other fragments.", "authors": ["Davide Bresolin", "Emilio Mu\u00f1oz-Velasco", "Guido Sciavicco"], "n_citation": 13, "references": ["0d2be3b4-ac31-416e-8ec2-5e9b23865ed5", "1d684925-0998-4d4d-92e1-2d8f349fff27", "20558c05-642c-48aa-948c-de331887cbf3", "30922b3c-27e1-4823-9a70-34fadb5b88cb", "3e3045bd-e5e9-480f-a562-205dc0c292a6", "4d023b6d-a6fe-4a0e-b148-4cfe2c352270", "4f8d026d-0cc4-471d-b9b6-0cadcac8ec32", "5624f645-293f-4cbb-b566-9c0fc0cdf8a1", "571a04b3-0674-4025-86b6-ba035f93523d", "57992104-c3b7-4121-a6eb-2d6b2653d955", "66ddcdcd-6769-4430-bb51-ef8018b5f2b4", "a29b92f1-1b44-43da-924f-e87ec70bab43", "b3913950-282d-44cf-9a25-4f94f2c11629", "b6960e1a-9d07-41f0-988c-ae54ca31273b", "b8bae814-7a40-4db8-a8cf-a95d75115820", "c8e03267-ad50-45e8-9eae-2cf44ba12414", "cf0833cc-5c47-47ec-8b04-f38f68f1545c", "dbe5ae2e-bbc0-4508-8df5-3ec95c784fa8", "dc7db399-a0f7-4ed5-a0ba-7586457c16bc", "ecf364b0-3dda-4aaa-ac93-f511ba64a00d", "fc95847c-9302-4040-b065-c8f9d1104a6c"], "title": "Sub-propositional Fragments of the Interval Temporal Logic of Allen's Relations", "venue": "", "year": 2014, "id": "43b29c76-3899-4980-bc59-115efc1aed9f"}

{"abstract": "Barrier is a collective operation used by many scientific applications and parallel libraries for synchronization. Typically, a Barrier operation is implemented by exchanging a short data message that requires demultiplexing, thereby adding undesired latency to the operation. In this work, we reduce the latency of Barrier operations for Cray XE/XK systems by leveraging the atomic operations provided by the Gemini interconnect, tailoring algorithms to utilize these capabilities, and utilizing a hierarchical design to arrive at an efficient implementation. Our micro-benchmark evaluation shows that for a 4,096 process Barrier operation, the atomic-operations-based Barrier outperforms the data exchange Barrier by 52% and the native Barrier by 111%.", "authors": ["Manjunath Gorentla Venkata", "Richard L.

{"abstract": "It is well known that, in nature, populations are dynamic in space and time. This means that the size of populations oscillate across their habitats over time. This work uses the concepts of habitats, ecological relationships, ecological successions and population dynamics to build a cooperative search algorithm, named ECO. This work aims to explore the population sizing not as a parameter but as a dynamic process. The Artificial Bee Colony (ABC) was used in the experiments where benchmark mathematical functions were optimized. Results were compared with ABC running alone, with and without the use of population dynamics.

{"abstract": "Data races are an important class of concurrency errors where two threads erroneously access a shared memory location without appropriate synchronization. This paper presents DataCollider, a lightweight and effective technique for dynamically detecting data races in kernel modules. Unlike existing data-race detection techniques, DataCollider is oblivious to the synchronization protocols (such as locking disciplines) the program uses to protect shared memory accesses. This is particularly important for low-level kernel code that uses a myriad of complex architecture/device specific synchronization mechanisms. To reduce the runtime overhead, DataCollider randomly samples a small percentage of memory accesses as candidates for data-race detection. The key novelty of DataCollider is that it uses breakpoint facilities already supported by many hardware architectures to achieve negligible runtime overheads. We have implemented DataCollider for the Windows 7 kernel and have found 25 confirmed erroneous data races of which 12 have already been fixed.", "authors": ["John Erickson", "Madanlal Musuvathi", "Sebastian Burckhardt", "Kirk Olynyk"], "n_citation": 150, "references": ["119162d6-0403-4980-8096-f6fa5d9fc228", "136c4780-2f25-4068-90a5-aed6afaf2890", "20b606d4-3c15-4578-9cd2-bd68c2bf7f44", "2fad3463-c71d-4fdc-bb31-781e27b57f54", "4cfc4b61-048f-435f-be1e-e2af9af49b7a", "6c20a4a2-0e3f-4446-b2e9-5f454d91b1c9", "7f0f937c-f854-47ff-b5fb-aca9314414b9", "84d6b71c-7e30-41c0-9d8c-fcd5e44b2550", "9acef219-b063-49cb-97e9-ca3f0b96e02f", "a4f95e3a-17b0-46ed-a588-341d2bc53a33", "b5894e8e-1774-45b2-9b34-23d2330878d0", "b79880dd-cea5-4109-bbb3-f86515c822a9", "bd702458-a06c-43bc-86aa-dec9f89e608e", "bf35b50a-762b-40f9-90e6-fe19daad008c", "cb07a6bc-7acc-4eb5-964f-c8ece4a6ed65", "de4c497b-5468-4ca6-bb18-d0c979688c10", "eb98ae5b-2b8a-4309-9fcb-a1ccb96b60f8"], "title": "Effective data-race detection for the kernel", "venue": "operating systems design and implementation", "year": 2010, "id": "447c98df-6b56-453c-a1f4-e442323f8945"}

{"abstract": "Enterprise architecture management is considered a valuable means to guide the consistent design and evolution of increasingly complex information systems.

We find that organizational culture significantly moderates the impact of EAM's design on EAM's success. In group culture, hierarchical culture and developmental culture it is essential to develop EAM from a passive into an actively designing approach to make it effective.

We first describe a data discovery extension to the classic ER conceptual model termed Entity Relationship Data Discovery (ERD2). We further present a novel logical model termed the Document Category Sets (DCS) model, used to represent entities and their relationships within an enhanced document model, and describe how data discovery requirements captured by the ERD2 conceptual model can be translated into the DCS logical model.

{"abstract": "We investigate the problem of incremental maintenance of materialized XML views. We are considering the case where the underlying database is a relational database and the view exposed to querying is a materialized XML view. Then, updates to the underlying database should be reflected to the stored XML view, to keep it consistent with the source data, without recreating the entire view from the database after each source update. Unlike related work that uses algebraic methods, we use source-to-source compositional transformations, guided by the database and view schemata. We first translate SQL updates to pure (update-free) XQuery expressions that reconstruct the entire database state, reflecting the updated values in the new state. Then, we synthesize the right-inverse of the XQuery view function, guided by the view schema. This inverse function is applied to the old view to derive the old database state, which in turn is mapped to the new database state through the update function, and then is mapped to the new view through the view function. The resulting view-to-view function is normalized and translated to XQuery updates that destructively modify the materialized view efficiently to reflect the new view values.", "authors": ["Leonidas Fegaras"], "n_citation": 50, "references": ["12d84dd3-23da-47fa-af68-e71d1d37576f", "2edfa6a9-e625-4541-821f-c0a67a1f1e5f", "2f29a1b5-53ec-4494-b20e-3e1a8cd45d92", "6e82382f-3cfd-4e1f-877d-67716d201f77", "71fb983f-1ac1-413c-901a-bf6abd8039af", "87497027-f67e-450d-bbd6-91b43a3d21ef", "8ac6af0c-89c7-4358-ae21-4fa80296a89c", "b22d5ed4-7ad0-4537-8181-d89da54e6631", "d92c89a5-d11a-4454-9650-3e95bc0d10f6", "f0ef7ddc-3778-4820-b227-b1d2e39132fa", "f3a4525a-6b31-4527-85e3-3d937947afd0"], "title": "Incremental maintenance of materialized XML views", "venue": "database and expert systems applications", "year": 2011, "id": "460ff872-7bb5-40f0-9215-4257e51ae7ab"}

{"abstract": "The Hierarchical Task Network (HTN) planning method is conceived of as a useful method for web service composition as well as being for task planning. However, no complete success of service composition by HTN is achieved as yet. The reason is the Web service composition process involves interactive dataflow between variables in precondition and input/output parameters of services. While such dataflow requires to evaluate variables in order to compose services, the performance of services is undesirable, because world-altering Web services cause to alter the world in composition processes. In this paper, instead of the HTN task planning method, we address more radical approach of HTN method for web service composition and decomposition on the premise of the openness and uncertainty of WWW. We capture composite services, which contain abstract concepts with respect to the variables of Web services, as abstract programs to be tailored to individual users and to be instantiated to executable programs in which every variable can ground in execution. In this view, the web service composition process can be conceived of as a sort of automated programming process, and HTN is deemed as a structural workflow or a prototype of actual programs. We formalize web service composition/decomposition by HTN method using the idea of satisfiability of situation calculus, and address the algorithm for Web service (de)composition that does not require to perform services.", "authors": ["Seiji Koide", "Hideaki Takeda"], "n_citation": 50, "references": ["00b04479-dab4-4127-a7ea-15d22a16de99", "29c6e9df-8fc8-4b68-a369-c8855efb366c", "387395e6-6712-4dda-9cb7-cf0fd7de42c7", "acc364d8-c6b9-47aa-bbd1-d70197c0703e", "bf6360a1-5e63-429f-b083-16f814ed5d1a", "c2ea584a-4f7b-465f-8ae9-f37a000e8e78"], "title": "Formulation of hierarchical task network service (de)composition", "venue": "", "year": 2007, "id": "465f678b-74ea-44d2-835b-729546795f1e"}
{"abstract": "In this paper we investigate the enhancement of speech by applying MMSE short-time spectral magnitude estimation in the modulation domain. For this purpose, the traditional analysismodification-synthesis framework is extended to include modulation domain processing. We compensate the noisy modulation spectrum for additive noise distortion by applying the MMSE short-time spectral magnitude estimation algorithm in the modulation domain. Subjective experiments were conducted to compare the quality of stimuli processed by the MMSE modulation magnitude estimator to those processed using the MMSE acoustic magnitude estimator and the modulation spectral subtraction method. The proposed method is shown to have better noise suppression than MMSE acoustic magnitude estimation, and improved speech quality compared to modulation domain spectral subtraction.

{"abstract": "This paper describes how a nascent collective of individuals can coalesce into a complex social system. The systematic study of such scenarios requires a mathematical framework within which to model the behavior of the individual members of the collective. As individuals interact, they develop social relationships and exchange resources --- that is, they develop social capital that quantifies the value of social influence that individuals exert on each other. Social capital can be expressed via conditional preference orderings for each individual. Conditional preferences reflect the influence relationships of an interacting social collective. Conditional preference orderings can then be aggregated via conditional game theory to form a concordant utility that provides an emergent group-level ordering of the harmony of interests of the members of the collective. We can thus develop a complete social model that takes into consideration all social relationships as they propagate through the system. Solution concepts can then be defined that simultaneously account for both group-level and individual-level interests.", "authors": ["Wynn C.

{"abstract": "For data classification, in fields like medicine, where vague concepts have to be considered, and where, at the same time, intelligible rules are required, research agrees on utility of fuzzy logic. In this ambit, if statistical information about the problem is known, or can be extracted from data, it can be used to define fuzzy sets and rules. Statistical knowledge can be acquired in terms of probability distributions or likelihood functions. Here, an approach is proposed for the transformation of likelihood functions into fuzzy sets, which considers possibility measure, and different methods arising from this approach are presented. By using real data, a comparison among different methods is performed, based on the analysis of transformation properties and resulting fuzzy sets characteristics.

Traditional logistic regression was compared to L1-regularized logistic regression (LASSO) in order to predict the radiological observations using computational features. The approach was evaluated by leave one out cross-validation. Informative radiological observations such as lesion enhancement, hypervascular attenuation, and homogeneous retention were predicted well by computational features.

{"abstract": "Current research on Internet of Things (IoT) mainly focuses on how to enable general objects to see, hear, and smell the physical world for themselves, and make them connected to share the observations. In this paper, we argue that only connected is not enough, beyond that, general objects should have the capability to learn, think, and understand both the physical world by themselves. On the other hand, the future IoT will be highly populated by large numbers of heterogeneous networked embedded devices, which are generating massive or big data in an explosive fashion. Although there is a consensus among almost everyone on the great importance of big data analytics in IoT, to date, limited results, especially the mathematical foundations, are obtained. These practical needs impels us to propose a systematic tutorial on the development of effective algorithms for big data analytics in future IoT, which are grouped into four classes: 1) heterogeneous data processing, 2) nonlinear data processing, 3) high-dimensional data processing, and 4) distributed and parallel data processing. We envision that the presented research is offered as a mere baby step in a potentially fruitful research direction.

{"abstract": "A new knowledge representation scheme called S-Net is presented. The S-Net is a descendent of both semantic networks and recently developed AI languages. We are willing to introduce procedures into our network notations as FRL and KRL do. However, these languages have a serious disadvantage that the programmer should specify, explicitly by using indicators such as WHEN-FILLED, TO-FILL etc., when the attached procedures are invoked. This results in the restriction of system's abilities of solving problems. To avoid this, the programmer should always pay attention to the overal control issues during the coding of his procedures. In our new formalism, the explicit specification is not necessary. The problem solver based on the S-Net dynamically determines which procedure is invoked when, according to the problem solving situations, not to the pre-specified indicators. We also discuss the problems of property inheritance through hierarchy. The inheritance mechanism provided so far is so restrictive that the programmer should do all things in his procedures. In the S-Net, the property inheritance is further augmented by the 'explicit path specification'. The detailed construction of the problem solver, which performs both forward and backward reasonings appropriately, is also given.", "authors": ["Makoto Nagao", "Jun'ichi Tsujii"], "n_citation": 4, "references": ["5a299e1c-1b42-4ba0-9d0b-fc8ef602feac"], "title": "S-NET: a foundation for knowledge representation languages", "venue": "international joint conference on artificial intelligence", "year": 1979, "id": "4821be99-ee80-4e28-89f2-6c8cc99f0ca2"}
{"abstract": "Healthcare web-application development teams involve non- computer experts working (clinicians) on the requirements specification that is later processed by software engineers/analysts (conceptual model) and coded by software programmers (software project). The management of this process, which involves different levels of abstraction and professionals with different backgrounds, is often complex. As such, mediators and facilitator's mecha- nisms for the requirements-gathering process and information transfer are need- ed. The main purpose of this work is to minimize the problems associated with this complex process, supporting the requirements engineering process of a healthcare web-application in a rapid prototyping model. The results proved that a rapid and functional prototyping model can improve the effectiveness of the requirement elicitation of any software development.", "authors": ["Leonor Teixeira", "Vasco Saavedra", "Carlos Ferreira", "Jo\u00e3o Pedro Sim\u00f5es", "Beatriz Sousa Santos"], "n_citation": 15, "references": ["0b14d4d6-0438-4cd7-b457-00440c14ba52", "26056b05-cd2d-4108-ac65-42b4680eeb08", "56dec375-91b2-4edd-9f61-9d7eae3c9718", "5c9292f8-a211-41f3-90b9-e1be4950949f", "ae7c6b26-3895-4a87-ae9e-0c19ed9b6731"], "title": "Requirements Engineering Using Mockups and Prototyping Tools: Developing a Healthcare Web-Application", "venue": "", "year": 2014, "id": "48275b1c-f47a-43d6-86d4-c44008811462"}
{"abstract": "In an improvised bodily expression, it is important to create the image inside the self. We developed a body expression generator called \"shadow media\" that generates an image by causing a gap between the body and its shadow. In this study, we focused on the dual residual shadow, a type of the shadow media, which generates a dual gap. Using this aspect of the shadow media, we develop new body expression media by introducing fluctuation and cellar automation to the boundary of the dual residual shadow. Experimental results indicate that these shadow media outputs can effectively support the generation of bodily expressions.", "authors": ["Naruhiro Hayashi", "Yoshiyuki Miwa", "Shiroh Itai", "Hiroko Nish"], "n_citation": 0, "references": ["7bade242-33f8-49ad-a6ae-dc1f1363ce18", "c42d46d5-3f5a-4a91-850d-7be1e6048d5d"], "title": "Bodily expression media by dual domain design of shadow", "venue": "", "year": 2013, "id": "482f4240-6d12-4769-8131-ef510c94f43b"}

{"abstract": "The Simple Network Management Protocol (SNMP) has been around for more than a decade and is supported by most network devices and end systems. Despite this success, there is still a lack of simple to use network management applications.This paper describes the design of an SNMP management tool called  scli  which provides an easy and efficient to use SNMP command line interface.

{"abstract": "Most memory corruption attacks and Internet worms follow a familiar pattern known as the control-data attack. Hence, many defensive techniques are designed to protect program control flow integrity. Although earlier work did suggest the existence of attacks that do not alter control flow, such attacks are generally believed to be rare against real-world software. The key contribution of this paper is to show that non-control-data attacks are realistic. We demonstrate that many real-world applications, including FTP, SSH, Telnet, and HTTP servers, are vulnerable to such attacks. In each case, the generated attack results in a security compromise equivalent to that due to the control-data attack exploiting the same security bug. Non-control-data attacks corrupt a variety of application data including user identity data, configuration data, user input data, and decision-making data. The success of these attacks and the variety of applications and target data suggest that potential attack patterns are diverse. Attackers are currently focused on control-data attacks, but it is clear that when control flow protection techniques shut them down, they have incentives to study and employ non-control-data attacks. This paper emphasizes the importance of future research efforts to address this realistic threat.", "authors": ["Shuo Chen", "Jun Xu", "Emre Can Sezer", "Prachi Gauriar", "Ravishankar K.
